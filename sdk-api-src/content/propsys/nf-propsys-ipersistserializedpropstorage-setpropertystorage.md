The <b>SERIALIZEDPROPSTORAGE</b> type is defined in Propsys.h as an incomplete type. It should be treated as an array of <b>BYTE</b> values; the format of the data returned is not specified. The data stored as a <b>SERIALIZEDPROPSTORAGE</b> structure must have been obtained through a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/86a1d7ec-759a-4b8a-91e1-4cfa28a17b41">IPersistSerializedPropStorage::GetPropertyStorage</a>, either directly or through persisted data that was generated by a call to that method.
