## -struct-fields




### -field SizeOfStruct

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structure. The calling application must set this member to <b>sizeof(FAX_JOB_ENTRY)</b> before it calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9068b1d-2cac-4128-b112-23febd846c15">FaxSetJob</a> function.


### -field JobId

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a unique number that identifies the fax job of interest. This number must match the value the calling application passes in the JobId parameter to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9068b1d-2cac-4128-b112-23febd846c15">FaxSetJob</a> function.


### -field UserName

#### JT_ROUTING

The fax server tried to route the fax transmission, but routing failed. The fax server will attempt to route the job again.



#### JT_FAIL_RECEIVE

The fax server did not route the fax because it did not receive the entire transmission. The fax server saves the partial transmission in a temporary directory.


### -field QueueStatus

#### JS_PAUSED

The fax server paused the fax job.



#### JS_NOLINE

There is no line available to send the fax. The fax server will send the transmission when a line is available.

## -remarks



A fax client application passes the <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structure in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9068b1d-2cac-4128-b112-23febd846c15">FaxSetJob</a> function.

An application can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d32cbef5-e548-4f66-bac6-c718c688547d">FaxEnumJobs</a> function to enumerate all queued and active fax jobs on the fax server of interest. <b>FaxEnumJobs</b> returns an array of <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structures. Each structure describes one fax job in detail.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7eb47777-cf5c-463d-bf19-5884c6fed04f">Managing Fax Jobs</a>.
