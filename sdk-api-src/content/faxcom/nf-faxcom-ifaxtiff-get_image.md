# IFaxTiff::get_Image


## -description


Sets or retrieves the <b>Image</b> property for a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/70acd518-4058-4146-bbdf-50108d0c7e3f">FaxTiff</a> object. The <b>Image</b> property is a null-terminated string that contains the full path and file name of the file represented by the FaxTiff object. The file is a Tagged Image File Format Class F (TIFF Class F) file.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



A fax client application must  set the <b>Image</b> property before retrieving another property for a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/70acd518-4058-4146-bbdf-50108d0c7e3f">FaxTiff</a> object.

A fax client application can call the <b>get_Image</b> retrieval method to determine the name of the facsimile image file that is open as a result of a successful call to the <b>put_Image</b> method.

A fax client application can use this retrieval method to determine the name of the facsimile image file that is open as a result of successful assignment of the <b>Image</b> property.

The <b>get_Image</b> method allocates the memory required for the buffer pointed to by the <i>pVal</i> parameter. The client application must call the <a href="8f230ee3-5f6e-4cb9-a910-9c90b754dcd3">SysFreeString</a> function to deallocate the resources associated with this parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a8371d98-8a66-484a-9179-4894ae0a7dfc">Freeing Fax Resources</a>.
