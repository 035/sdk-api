# IOleDocumentView::Clone


## -description


Creates a duplicate view object with an internal state identical to that of the current view.


## -parameters




### -param pIPSiteNew [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6d37e022-8c19-48b3-affb-e0eca19b5e05">IOleInPlaceSite</a> interface that represents the view site in which the new view object will be activated. On receiving this pointer, the view being cloned should pass it to the new view's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/88de47c2-979b-4595-8a2f-d4ed1a3a7b6c">IOleDocumentView::SetInPlaceSite</a> method. This pointer can be <b>NULL</b>, in which case the caller is responsible for calling <b>IOleDocumentView::SetInPlaceSite</b> on the new view directly.


### -param ppViewNew [out]

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/07948c08-f047-4ae0-a41b-5410b4bbf4d6">IOleDocumentView</a> pointer variable that receives the interface pointer to the new view object. The caller is responsible for releasing <i>ppViewNew</i> when it is no longer needed.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK on success. Other possible return values include the following.

<table>

<dt><b>E_NOTIMPL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

</table>
 




## -remarks



This method is useful for creating a new view with a different viewport and view site but with the same view context as the view being cloned. Typically, containers hosting an MDI application will call this method to provide "Window/New window" capability.
