## -remarks



This method releases the terminals and releases the Terminal Manager. It releases all unprocessed events, and calls 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn927275">Stop</a> on the global MSP thread object. When this function is called, no call should be alive. However, bugs in the application may keep calls or terminals around.
