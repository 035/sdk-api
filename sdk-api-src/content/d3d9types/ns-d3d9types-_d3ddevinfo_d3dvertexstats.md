# _D3DDEVINFO_D3DVERTEXSTATS structure


## -description


Reports the number of triangles that have been processed and clipped by the runtime's software vertex processing.


## -struct-fields




### -field NumRenderedTriangles

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">DWORD</a></b>

Total number of triangles that are not clipped in this frame.


### -field NumExtraClippingTriangles

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">DWORD</a></b>

Number of new triangles generated by clipping.


## -remarks



Use the debug runtime and software vertex processing to get the number of non-clipped and clipped primitives for a particular scene. Primitives will typically be clipped based on a guard band (if one is present). The clipping guard band is set with parameters such as GuardBandLeft in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/44457b7b-a1f7-4019-b971-8ec2334d3313">D3DCAPS9</a>.
