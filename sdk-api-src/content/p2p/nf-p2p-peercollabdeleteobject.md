## -remarks



Peer objects are run-time data items associated with a particular application, such as a picture, an avatar, a certificate, or a specific description. Each peer object must be smaller than 3216K in size.

Trusted contacts watching this peer object and the subscriber of the "Me" contact will have a PEER_EVENT_OBJECT_CHANGED event raised, signaling this peer object's change in status. PEER_EVENT_MY_OBJECT_CHANGED will be raised locally.

Pre-defined objects, like Picture objects, cannot be deleted by calling this API.
