## -struct-fields




### -field pContact

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b84a17fc-35d6-4098-9bb3-18e708541a80">PEER_CONTACT</a> structure that contains the peer contact information for a contact whose change in application  raised the event.


### -field pEndpoint

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9687b332-14ed-4023-b8c2-437d75fd0298">PEER_ENDPOINT</a> structure that contains the peer endpoint information for a contact whose change in application information raised the event.


### -field changeType


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ef8f1cc7-e1db-4d6d-9ff6-141746d0787a">PEER_CHANGE_TYPE</a> enumeration value that specifies the type of application change that occurred.


### -field pApplication

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a219231b-75d0-47d3-8294-f1cc25b43d27">PEER_APPLICATION</a> structure that contains the changed application information.


## -remarks



"Application" is a set of software or software  features available on the peer's endpoint. Commonly, this refers to software packages that support peer networking activities, like games or other collaborative applications.

A peer's application has a GUID representing a single specific application. When an application is registered for a peer, this GUID and the corresponding application can be made available to all trusted contacts of the peer, indicating the activities the peer can participate in. To deregister a peer's application, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2479b726-20f1-4370-9fcf-f29cec44c3ec">PeerCollabUnregisterApplication</a> with this GUID.

When a new application is registered locally using PeerCollabRegisterApplication or unregistered using PeerCollabUnregisterApplication all peers subscribed to the local peer's presence information receive the PEER_EVENT_ENDPOINT_APPLICATION_CHANGED event. Locally, applications receive the PEER_EVENT_MY_APPLICATION_CHANGED event. 

The <b>current user</b> scope has priority over the <b>all user</b> scope. If the application is registered in both scopes, the event will be fired only if the <b>current user</b> scope is changed.
