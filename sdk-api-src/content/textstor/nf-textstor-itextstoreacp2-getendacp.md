The application has not implemented this method. This is usually an indication that calculating the end position requires excessive resources. If the end position is necessary, you can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn926850">GetText</a> to calculate it, though this can also be a memory-intensive operation, paging in arbitrarily large amounts of memory from disk.
