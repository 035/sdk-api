# PTCloseProvider function


## -description


Closes a print ticket provider handle.


## -parameters




### -param hProvider [in]

A handle to the provider. This handle is returned by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6821b1b0-74b0-4caf-b8e6-a9df4d7693d7">PTOpenProvider</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0e65170b-66f6-4238-bdde-0a0b7108a686">PTOpenProviderEx</a> function.


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the return value is S_OK, otherwise the <b>HRESULT</b> contains an error code.

If <i>hProvider</i> was opened in a different thread, the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_INVALIDARG.

For more information about COM error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544310">Error Handling</a>.




## -remarks



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is a blocking or synchronous function and might not return immediately. How quickly this function returns depends on run-time factors such as network status, print server configuration, and printer driver implementation—factors that are difficult to predict when writing an application. Calling this function from a thread that manages interaction with the user interface could make the application appear to be unresponsive.</div>
<div> </div>
The <i>hProvider</i> parameter must be a handle that was opened in the same thread as the thread in which it is used for this function. 
      

A handle cannot be used after it is closed.
