## -remarks



The TTL is more or less significant in the implementation of multicast routing. Generally, the higher the TTL value, the "larger" or more inclusive the multicast scope. Most applications need not address the TTL.

This function may send data over the wire in unencrypted form; therefore, someone eavesdropping on the network may be able to read the data. The security risk of sending the data in clear text should be considered before using this method.
