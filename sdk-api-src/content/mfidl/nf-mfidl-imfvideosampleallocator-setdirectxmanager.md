# IMFVideoSampleAllocator::SetDirectXManager


## -description



Specifies the Direct3D device manager for the video media sink to use.




## -parameters




### -param pManager [in]

Pointer to the <b>IUnknown</b> interface of the Direct3D device manager. The media sink queries this pointer for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e661e666-dc51-4a71-9ecd-62a667bb217d">IDirect3DDeviceManager9</a> interface.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>

</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The media sink uses the Direct3D device manager to obtain a pointer to the Direct3D device, which it uses to allocate Direct3D surfaces. The device manager enables multiple objects in the pipeline (such as a video renderer and a video decoder) to share the same Direct3D device.
