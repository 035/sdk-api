# IMFHttpDownloadRequest::BeginSendRequest


## -description


Invoked by Microsoft Media Foundation to send a HTTP or HTTPS request


## -parameters




### -param pbPayload [in]

Pointer to a buffer that contains the message payload to send in the request. This parameter is used for POST requests. GET requests do not carry a message payload and therefore <i>pbPayload</i> is NULL.


### -param cbPayload [in]

The size of the <i>pbPayload</i> buffer, in bytes.


### -param pCallback [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7edff985-da59-4cc0-96de-1a92e03a7d41">IMFAsyncCallback</a> interface of a callback object that is implemented by Microsoft Media Foundation.


### -param punkState

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface of a state object, defined by Microsoft Media Foundation. This parameter can be NULL.


## -returns




            The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.
          

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

                Successfully started the asynchronous operation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

                There is insufficient memory to complete the operation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The implementation of <b>BeginWrite</b> does not need to make a private copy of the memory pointed to by <i>pbPayload</i>, as Microsoft Media Foundation will not reallocate, free, or write to the buffer while an asynchronous write is still pending.
