## -remarks



When this method is called, it increments the lock count on the PMP process. For every call to this method, the application should make a corresponding call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2f64252f-c08b-4624-8df6-db922a630891">IMFPMPServer::UnlockProcess</a>, which decrements the lock count. When the PMP process is ready to exit, it waits for about 3 seconds, or until the lock count reaches zero, before exiting.
