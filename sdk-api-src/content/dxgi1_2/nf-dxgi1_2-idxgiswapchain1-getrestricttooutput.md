# IDXGISwapChain1::GetRestrictToOutput


## -description


Gets the output (the display monitor) to which you can restrict the contents of a present operation.


## -parameters




### -param ppRestrictToOutput [out]

 A pointer to a buffer that receives a pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c641995e-a4d9-4bfb-bdc0-7ffbe77c3599">IDXGIOutput</a> interface for the restrict-to output. An application passes this pointer to <b>IDXGIOutput</b> in a call to the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B78E9F87-C6B0-4078-8C59-AFB85B9C3CBD">IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B3AC3AEB-3449-4444-9FD3-866A3795C41F">IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCoreWindow</a>, or  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8AE13082-F8C3-422A-A111-4E91488BD1AF">IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForComposition</a> method to create the swap chain.


## -returns



Returns S_OK if the restrict-to output was successfully retrieved; otherwise, returns E_INVALIDARG if the pointer is invalid.




## -remarks



If the method succeeds, the runtime fills the buffer at <i>ppRestrictToOutput</i> with a pointer to the restrict-to output interface. This restrict-to output interface has its reference count incremented. When you are finished with it, be sure to release the interface to avoid a memory leak.

The output is also owned by the adapter on which the swap chain's device was created.
