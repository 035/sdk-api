# IMFPMediaPlayer::GetState


## -description



<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows. Applications should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dac99908-be90-415d-8837-2f97d573feb5">Media Session</a> for playback.</div>
<div> </div>


Gets the current playback state of the MFPlay player object.


## -parameters




### -param peState [out]

Receives the playback state, as a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0d5c840-a1aa-48cf-bf2e-7e5c35951fb6">MFP_MEDIAPLAYER_STATE</a> enumeration.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method can be called after the player object has been shut down.

Many of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fa57d465-1ee9-4f7a-9be8-66a6d73f65e8">IMFPMediaPlayer</a> methods complete asynchronously. While an asynchronous operation is pending, the current state is not updated until the operation completes. When the operation completes, the application receives an event callback, and the new state is given in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ed9d3790-845a-4392-b755-6a5ce6e20de5">MFP_EVENT_HEADER</a> structure that is passed to the callback.
