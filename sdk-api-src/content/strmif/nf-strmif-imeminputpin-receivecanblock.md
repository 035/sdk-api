# IMemInputPin::ReceiveCanBlock


## -description



The <code>ReceiveCanBlock</code> method determines whether calls to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7cc1e57a-a18a-4ea4-9669-0be3fb140d40">IMemInputPin::Receive</a> method might block.




## -parameters






## -returns



Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. Possible values include those shown in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The pin will not block on a call to <b>Receive</b>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The pin might block on a call to <b>Receive</b>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



If this method returns S_FALSE, calls to the <b>Receive</b> method are guaranteed not to block. Otherwise, they might block. An upstream filter can use this method to determine its threading strategy. If calls to <b>Receive</b> can block, the upstream filter might decide to use a worker thread that buffers data.
