# IAMTuner::put_TuningSpace


## -description



The <code>put_TuningSpace</code> method sets a storage index for regional channel-to-frequency mappings.




## -parameters




### -param lTuningSpace [in]

Value indicating the current locale.


## -returns



Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that depends on the implementation of the interface.




## -remarks



As TV tuners move into portable systems, you must retain locale-specific mappings of available channels and their actual frequencies. Formulating different <i>lTuningSpace</i> values for each locale provides a way of switching the channel-to-frequency mappings when moving from region to region.
