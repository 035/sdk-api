# IPinFlowControl interface


## -description



Blocks data flow from an active output pin. This interface is exposed by output pins that can reconnect dynamically. Use this interface to start a dynamic reconnection within the filter graph. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/13fed430-979b-40f7-91ba-aff2d811bd92">Dynamic Graph Building</a>.

<b>Filter developers: </b>Parser and capture filters that support dynamic reconnection should support this interface on their output pins. Generally, other types of filters do not need to implement this interface.
