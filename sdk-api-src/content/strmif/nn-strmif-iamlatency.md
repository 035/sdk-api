# IAMLatency interface


## -description



The <code>IAMLatency</code> interface reports the amount of latency that a filter introduces into the graph. Latency is defined as the time that it takes the filter to process a sample. For a source filter, latency is the filter's maximum buffer size, measured in time. For example, a video capture filter that buffers one frame at 30 frames per second introduces a latency of about 33 milliseconds.

Currently, there is no support for using this interface by itself. A source filter that streams live or real-time data should implement the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5ab294a8-f250-405c-a589-68998bc04cdf">IAMPushSource</a> interface, which inherits from this interface.




## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IAMLatency</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAMLatency</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>

</ul>

## -members

The <b>IAMLatency</b> interface has these methods.
