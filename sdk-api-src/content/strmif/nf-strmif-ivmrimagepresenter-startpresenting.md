# IVMRImagePresenter::StartPresenting


## -description



The <code>StartPresenting</code> method is called just before the video starts playing. The allocator-presenter should perform any necessary configuration in this method.




## -parameters




### -param dwUserID [in]

An application-defined <b>DWORD_PTR</b> cookie that uniquely identifies this instance of the VMR for use in scenarios when one instance of the allocator-presenter is used with multiple VMR instances.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an error code.




## -remarks



<b>PresentImage</b> can be called when the filter is in either a running or a paused state. <code>StartPresenting</code> and <b>StopPresenting</b> can be called only in a running state. Therefore, if the graph is paused before it is run, <b>PresentImage</b> will be called before <code>StartPresenting</code>.
