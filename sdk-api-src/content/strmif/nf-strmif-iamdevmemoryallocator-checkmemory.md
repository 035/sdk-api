# IAMDevMemoryAllocator::CheckMemory


## -description



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <b>IAMDevMemoryAllocator</b> interface is deprecated.</div>
<div> </div>
Tests whether the specific instance (device) of the allocator allocated a memory pointer.




## -parameters




### -param pBuffer [in]

Pointer to the allocated memory buffer's address.


## -returns



Returns S_OK if the on-board allocator allocated the memory, or S_FALSE if not. Memory that is on the particular device but not allocated will also return S_FALSE.




## -remarks



The hardware filter typically uses this method to test whether the pointer actually points to on-board memory.
