# IPin::EndOfStream


## -description



The <code>EndOfStream</code> method notifies the pin that no additional data is expected, until a new run command is issued to the filter.



Applications should not call this method. This method is called by other filters to signal the end of the stream.


## -parameters






## -returns



Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. Possible values include the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Success.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The pin is an output pin.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Call this method only on input pins. Output pins return E_UNEXPECTED.

This method sends an end-of-stream notification to the pin. The pin delivers the notification downstream. It must serialize end-of-stream notifications with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7cc1e57a-a18a-4ea4-9669-0be3fb140d40">IMemInputPin::Receive</a> calls. If the pin queues media samples for delivery, it should queue end-of-stream notifications as well. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/15563666-5f35-46a0-ad12-215979c9d9c1">IPin::BeginFlush</a> method flushes any queued end-of-stream notifications.
