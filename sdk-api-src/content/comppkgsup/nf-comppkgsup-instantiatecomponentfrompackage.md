## -remarks



This function can only be used with packages whose "PackageFamilyName"  is defined as a subkey key that is registered under the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MediaEngine\MediaExtensions\EME\CDMS" key. 

 This API should only be called in very exceptional circumstances because code installed from the application store should not be invoked from desktop applications as it is has a lower level of trust associated with it.
