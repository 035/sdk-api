# IMediaObject::Lock


## -description



The <code>Lock</code> method acquires or releases a lock on the DMO. Call this method to keep the DMO serialized when performing multiple operations.




## -parameters




### -param bLock

Value that specifies whether to acquire or release the lock. If the value is non-zero, a lock is acquired. If the value is zero, the lock is released.


## -returns



Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. Possible values include those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Failure

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Success

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 




## -remarks



This method prevents other threads from calling methods on the DMO. If another thread calls a method on the DMO, the thread blocks until the lock is released.

If you are using the Active Template Library (ATL) to implement a DMO, the name of the Lock method conflicts with the <b>CComObjectRootEx::Lock</b> method. To work around this problem, define the preprocessor symbol FIX_LOCK_NAME before including the header file Dmo.h:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
#define FIX_LOCK_NAME
#include &lt;dmo.h&gt;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
This directive causes the preprocessor to rename the <b>IMediaObject</b> method to <i>DMOLock</i>. In your DMO, implement the method as <i>DMOLock</i>. In your implementation, call the ATL <b>Lock</b> or <b>Unlock</b> method, depending on the value of <i>bLock</i>. Applications can still invoke the method using the name <i>Lock</i> because the vtable order does not change.
