# tagNMTBRESTORE structure


## -description


Allows applications to extract the information that was placed in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6cfad7d3-6730-4f03-8804-b44ea4d9bbd7">NMTBSAVE</a> when the toolbar state was saved. This structure is passed to applications when they receive a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b1f0c801-d56b-4e93-b9ba-b572aaa38647">TBN_RESTORE</a> notification code.


## -struct-fields




### -field hdr

 


### -field pData

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">DWORD</a>*</b>

Pointer to the data stream with the stored save information. It contains Shell-defined blocks of information for each button, alternating with application-defined blocks. Applications may also place a block of global data at the start of 
					<b>pData</b>. The format and length of the application-defined blocks are determined by the application. 


### -field pCurrent

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">DWORD</a>*</b>

Pointer to the current block of application-defined data. After extracting the data, the application must advance 
					<b>pCurrent</b> to the end of the block, so it is pointing to the next block of Shell-defined data. 


### -field cbData

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">UINT</a></b>

Size of 
					<b>pData</b>. 


### -field iItem

Type: <b>int</b>

Value of -1 indicates that the restore is starting, and 
					<b>pCurrent</b> will point to the start of the data stream. Otherwise, it is the zero-based button index, and 
					<b>pCurrent</b> will point to the current button's data. 


### -field cButtons

Type: <b>int</b>

Estimate of the number of buttons. Because the estimate is based on the size of the data stream, it might be incorrect. The client should update it as appropriate. 


### -field cbBytesPerRecord

Type: <b>int</b>

Number of bytes needed to hold the data for each button. When the restore starts, 
					<b>cbBytesPerRecord</b> will be set to the size of the Shell-defined data structure. You need to increment it by the size of the structure that holds the application-defined data.


### -field tbButton

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c7dea982-d8b3-44e1-a4d2-3cca560c2096">TBBUTTON</a></b>


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c7dea982-d8b3-44e1-a4d2-3cca560c2096">TBBUTTON</a> structure that contains information about the button currently being restored. Applications must modify this structure as necessary before returning. 


#### - nmhdr

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0c8b116b-82ad-495a-b19d-8c172e0b2608">NMHDR</a></b>


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0c8b116b-82ad-495a-b19d-8c172e0b2608">NMHDR</a> structure that contains additional information about the notification.
