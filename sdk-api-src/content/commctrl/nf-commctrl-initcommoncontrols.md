# InitCommonControls function


## -description


Registers and initializes certain common control window classes. This function is obsolete. New applications should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0ca2152-673e-4920-ae78-1421fdec1a05">InitCommonControlsEx</a> function. 


## -parameters






## -returns



This function does not return a value.




## -remarks



Under Comctl32.dll version 5.x, only WindowsÂ 95 classes (ICC_WIN95_CLASSES) can be registered through <b>InitCommonControls</b>. Programs which require additional common control classes must use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0ca2152-673e-4920-ae78-1421fdec1a05">InitCommonControlsEx</a> function.

Under Comctl32.dll version 6.0 and later, <b>InitCommonControls</b> does nothing. Applications must explicitly register all common controls through <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0ca2152-673e-4920-ae78-1421fdec1a05">InitCommonControlsEx</a>.
