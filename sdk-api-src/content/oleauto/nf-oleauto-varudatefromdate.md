## -remarks



The UDATE structure is used with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1c924ac5-b896-49e1-9ccf-825ac7a030c8">VarDateFromUdate</a> and <b>VarUdateFromDate</b>.  It represents an "unpacked" date.

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>typedef struct {
    SYSTEMTIME st;
    USHORT  wDayOfYear;
} UDATE;</code></pre>
The <b>VarUdateFromDate</b> function will accept invalid dates and try to fix them when resolving to a VARIANT time. For example, an invalid date such as 2/29/2001 will resolve to 3/1/2001. Only days are fixed, so invalid month values result in an error being returned. Days are checked to be between 1 and 31. Negative days and days greater than 31 results in an error. A day less than 31 but greater than the maximum day in that month has the day promoted to the appropriate day of the next month. A day equal to zero resolves as the last day of the previous month. For example, an invalid dates such as 2/0/2001 will resolve to 1/31/2001.
