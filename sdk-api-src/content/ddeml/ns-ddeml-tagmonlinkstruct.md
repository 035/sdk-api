# tagMONLINKSTRUCT structure


## -description


Contains information about a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) advise loop. A DDE monitoring application can use this structure to obtain information about an advise loop that has started or ended. 


## -struct-fields




### -field cb

Type: <b>UINT</b>

The structure's size, in bytes. 


### -field dwTime

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The Windows time at which the advise loop was started or ended. Windows time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was booted. 


### -field hTask

Type: <b>HANDLE</b>

A handle to a task (application instance) that is a partner in the advise loop. 


### -field fEstablished

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Indicates whether an advise loop was successfully established. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates an advise loop was established; <b>FALSE</b> indicates it was not. 


### -field fNoData

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Indicates whether the XTYPF_NODATA flag is set for the advise loop. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates the flag is set; <b>FALSE</b> indicates it is not. 


### -field hszSvc

Type: <b>HSZ</b>

A handle to the service name of the server in the advise loop. 


### -field hszTopic

Type: <b>HSZ</b>

A handle to the topic name on which the advise loop is established. 


### -field hszItem

Type: <b>HSZ</b>

A handle to the item name that is the subject of the advise loop. 


### -field wFmt

Type: <b>UINT</b>

The format of the data exchanged (if any) during the advise loop. 


### -field fServer

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Indicates whether the link notification came from the server. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates the notification came from the server; <b>FALSE</b> indicates otherwise. 


### -field hConvServer

Type: <b>HCONV</b>

A handle to the server conversation. 


### -field hConvClient

Type: <b>HCONV</b>

A handle to the client conversation. 


## -remarks



Because string handles are local to the process, the <b>hszSvc</b>, <b>hszTopic</b>, and <b>hszItem</b> members are global atoms. 

The 
				<b>hConvClient</b> and <b>hConvServer</b> members of the <b>MONLINKSTRUCT</b> structure do not hold the same value as would be seen by the applications engaged in the conversation. Instead, they hold a globally unique pair of values that identify the conversation.
