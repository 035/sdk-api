## -remarks




        This function may only be used to obtain the values of attributes in scope that use the prefix "xml".
      


        If no matching xml attribute is found, a zero length string will be returned for the value, and the
        function returns S_FALSE.
      


        The reader does not do anything with xml attributes other than to surface them for inspection.
