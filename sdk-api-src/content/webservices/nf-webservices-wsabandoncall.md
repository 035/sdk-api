## -remarks




                    Calls are identified by a call ID. This call ID is associated with the call by the WS_CALL_PROPERTY_CALL_ID  value of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d61b6763-9770-4f1d-b16f-c63fc09e8af5">WS_CALL_PROPERTY_ID</a> enumeration. 
              


                    If the call ID is 0,  all pending calls on the service proxy are abandoned.
              For more information,
                    see the following topics:
                    <ul>
<li>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9d6e2441-91de-4108-b1c4-282fbca5fe7c">Client Side Service Operations</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/71253dd6-4f59-4acd-b244-c721834ca381">CallAbandonExample</a>
</li>
</ul>


Be aware that the actual I/O associated with the call is not canceled. The service proxy keeps the resources to complete the call even though the call was abandoned. 
            


                This results in a consumption of resources that is aggravated if an application continues to abandon calls, as can happen when the server is slow to respond  to the 
                client, and the client application abandons one call only to make the same call again.
