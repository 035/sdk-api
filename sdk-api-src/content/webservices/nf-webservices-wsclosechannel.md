## -remarks



If you open a channel or successfully accept a channel, you must close it when it is no longer needed. After a channel has been closed, the associated resources can safely be  freed.

The channel-closing process will wait for any already initiated, pending I/O to complete. 



If there are no messages currently being read or written for the channel, the channel attempts a graceful shutdown. Otherwise, all I/O still pending on the channel itself is aborted and the channel does a rude shutdown. 

If the channel attempts a graceful shutdown but encounters an error, <b>WsCloseChannel</b> will return an error, but the channel will still be closed. 



This operation is allowed only if the channel is in WS_CHANNEL_STATE_OPEN or WS_CHANNEL_STATE_FAULTED states.


                Closing a channel automatically disassociates any messages that are in the
                process of being read or written. Therefore, it is not necessary to call 
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b8f5da50-d296-4550-8810-114d1f0e810b">WsAbandonMessage</a> before calling <b>WsCloseChannel</b>).
