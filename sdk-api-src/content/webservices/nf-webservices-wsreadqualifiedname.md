# WsReadQualifiedName function


## -description



        Reads a qualified name and separates it into its prefix, localName 
        and namespace based on the current namespace scope of the XML_READER. 
        If the ns parameter is specified, then the namespace that the prefix 
        is bound to will be returned, or <b>WS_E_INVALID_FORMAT</b>
        will be returned. (See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/96285557-8317-4875-b634-e2eacd605901">Windows Web Services Return Values</a>.) The strings are placed in the specified heap.
      


## -parameters




### -param reader [in]


          The reader which should read the qualified name.
        


### -param heap [in]


          The heap on which the resulting strings should be allocated.
        


### -param prefix


          The prefix of the qualified name is returned here.
        


### -param localName [out]


          The localName of the qualified name is returned here.
        


### -param ns


          The namespace to which the qualified name is bound is returned here.
        


### -param error [in, optional]


          If the localName is missing the function will return <b>WS_E_INVALID_FORMAT</b>.  
          If the ns parameter is specified, but the prefix is not bound to a namespace, 
           <b>WS_E_INVALID_FORMAT</b> will be returned.
