# WsPushBytes function


## -description


Establishes a callback to be invoked to write bytes within an element.  In some encodings this can
        be more efficient by eliminating a copy of the data.
      


## -parameters




### -param writer [in]

A pointer to the XML Writer object to which the bytes are written.  The pointer must reference a valid <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8f413e60-8a30-492c-8f2d-80be511fee11">WS_XML_WRITER</a> and   the referenced value may not be <b>NULL</b>.
                


### -param callback [in]

This parameter is the callback to invoke to write the data.
        


### -param callbackState [in, optional]

A pointer to a user-defined state that is  passed to the callback function.
        


### -param error [in, optional]

A  pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d5763d93-8eff-4df8-9a8a-a58aefabcb21">WS_ERROR</a> object where additional information about the error should be stored if the function fails.
                


## -returns



This function can return one of these values.

## -remarks




        When writing with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/18236818-492f-4906-9e7d-6ca03ef28d36">WS_XML_WRITER_MTOM_ENCODING</a>, <b>WsPushBytes</b> provides a way
        to write bytes directly into its own MIME part and avoid a copy.  However, the writer at its discretion,
        may choose to invoke the callback immediately, so the caller should be prepared for this.
      


        If the encoding cannot take advantage of this behavior, then <b>WsPushBytes</b> will invoke the
        callback immediately and operate as if <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1fa9ecfc-c791-459f-ae11-ffcdc82b7145">WsWriteBytes</a> was called.
