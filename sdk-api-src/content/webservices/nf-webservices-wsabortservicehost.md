## -remarks



<b>WsAbortServiceHost</b> aborts all  listeners on the service host, and as a result, no new channels are accepted from the client. All channels currently being used by the service host to service messages are aborted as well. 

If a call is pending and it has a cancel callback registered through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e456814-f70f-47ab-b866-f0b73d5cd35e">WsRegisterOperationForCancel</a> function, the callback is called. However, the runtime still waits for the call to complete. 


           

For more information on registering for cancellation notification,
                see  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e456814-f70f-47ab-b866-f0b73d5cd35e">WsRegisterOperationForCancel</a>.
