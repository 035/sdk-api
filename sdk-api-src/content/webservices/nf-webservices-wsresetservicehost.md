# WsResetServiceHost function


## -description



                Resets service host so that it can be opened again.
            


                Rather the creating a new service host from scratch <b>WsResetServiceHost</b> 
                provides a convenient way to reuse service host. Specifically in a scenario 
                where a service host has to go through close and open on a regular basis, 
                this allows for an efficient way for reusing the same service host. It resets 
                the underlying channel and listeners for reuse.
