</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

                    This is returned if the channel is not in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3a7f5bbd-e484-4a7e-8e5d-df229a7227a5">WS_CHANNEL_STATE_OPEN</a>state.

## -remarks




                This function will indicate to the remote party that all
                messages have been sent for the channel.
            


                                The remote party can detect that no more messages are available on the channel by 
                looking for the <b>WS_S_END</b> return value when receiving a message. (See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/96285557-8317-4875-b634-e2eacd605901">Windows Web Services Return Values</a>.) However, 
                messages can also become unavailable if the non-application messages were filtered by 
                the channel as described in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d7dddcc6-8eb0-4ee6-8cf5-7701a2be7a19">Channel Layer Overview</a>. Session shutdown can 
                be distinguished from message filtering by keeping track of whether prior messages were 
                received. If prior messages were received then the session was shut down.



                This function only applies to channels created with a
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7e1092f9-10e8-485c-a286-770e1c74d8ca">WS_CHANNEL_TYPE</a> with a session that support
                sending of messages:
            

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7e1092f9-10e8-485c-a286-770e1c74d8ca">WS_CHANNEL_TYPE_OUTPUT_SESSION</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7e1092f9-10e8-485c-a286-770e1c74d8ca">WS_CHANNEL_TYPE_DUPLEX_SESSION</a>
</li>
</ul>

                The channel must be in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3a7f5bbd-e484-4a7e-8e5d-df229a7227a5">WS_CHANNEL_STATE_OPEN</a> state.
            


                If this function is successful, the value of the
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3207c7f0-7f12-4f6b-8ddd-bac9c06ccfbf">WS_CHANNEL_PROPERTY_IS_SESSION_SHUT_DOWN</a> property
                will be <b>TRUE</b>.
            


                Once a session channel has been shut down, attempting
                to send a message on the channel or attempting to shut down
                the channel will return <b>WS_E_INVALID_OPERATION</b>.
            


                Calling this function is optional.  When a session channel is closed using 
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e4928371-a172-4cc8-968b-12ae2ee2e0c6">WsCloseChannel</a> when in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3a7f5bbd-e484-4a7e-8e5d-df229a7227a5">WS_CHANNEL_STATE_OPEN</a>,
                then the channel is automatically shut down as part of the close process.
