# WlxLogoff function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The WlxLogoff function is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]


			The <b>WlxLogoff</b> function must be implemented by a replacement <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c9567a5b-bd56-4ae1-9eac-af0bb5a6842a">GINA</a> DLL. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn927313">Winlogon</a> calls this function to notify the GINA of a logoff operation on this workstation, allowing the GINA to perform any logoff operations that may be required.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>   GINA DLLs are ignored in Windows Vista.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param pWlxContext [in]

A pointer to the GINA context associated with this window station. The GINA returns this context value when Winlogon calls 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/db03f2b3-0719-40be-8a42-04ab7110f711">WlxInitialize</a> for this station.


## -returns



This function does not return a value.




## -remarks



Before calling <b>WlxLogoff</b>, Winlogon sets the desktop state so that the current desktop is the Winlogon desktop and sets the workstation state so that the desktop is locked.
