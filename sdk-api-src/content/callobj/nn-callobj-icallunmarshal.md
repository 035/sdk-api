# ICallUnmarshal interface


## -description


Is used on the server (receiving) side of a remote invocation. An appropriate instance of <b>ICallUnmarshal</b> can be used to transform back into an call frame a method invocation previously marshaled by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cab40c31-1f89-4da9-a1e0-ef946b34665c">ICallFrame::Marshal</a> on the client (sending) side. After such a reconstituted call frame is obtained, the call can be carried out on an actual object using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/75cb7b96-55c9-4aee-b507-a549e2af38bc">ICallFrame::Invoke</a>.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ICallUnmarshal</b> interface inherits from the <a href="iunknown.htm">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ICallUnmarshal</b> also has these types of members:
