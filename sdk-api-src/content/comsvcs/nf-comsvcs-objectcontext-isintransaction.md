An unexpected error has occurred. This can happen if one object passes its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/09a17e57-7224-43bc-93c7-16ab95ca2517">ObjectContext</a> pointer to another object and the other object calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/843fa973-2c54-4026-8dd9-4ca949b3a894">IsInTransaction</a> using this pointer. An <b>ObjectContext</b> pointer is not valid outside the context of the object that originally obtained it.

</td>

</table>
 




## -remarks



You can use this method to ensure that an object that requires a transaction never runs without one. For example, if a component that requires a transaction is improperly configured in the Component Services administration tool, you can use this method to determine that the object does not have a transaction. Then you can return an error to alert the user to the problem, or take whatever action is appropriate.
