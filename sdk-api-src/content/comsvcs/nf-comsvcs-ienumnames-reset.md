# IEnumNames::Reset


## -description


Resets the enumeration sequence to the beginning.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, and E_FAIL, as well as the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The enumeration sequence was reset.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The enumeration sequence was reset, but there are no items in the enumerator.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



You can use the S_FALSE return value as an optimization to detect an empty enumeration.

A call to this method, resetting the sequence, does not guarantee that the same set of objects will be enumerated after the reset, because the collection may have changed.
