# IObjectContext::IsInTransaction


## -description


Indicates whether the object is executing within a transaction.


## -parameters






## -returns



If the current object is executing within a transaction, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



You can use this method to ensure that an object that requires a transaction never runs without one. For example, if a component that requires a transaction is improperly configured in the Component Services administration tool, you can use this method to determine that the object does not have a transaction. Then you can return an error to alert the user to the problem, or take whatever action is appropriate.
