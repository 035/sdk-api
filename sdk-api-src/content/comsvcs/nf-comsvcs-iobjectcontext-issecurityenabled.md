# IObjectContext::IsSecurityEnabled


## -description


Indicates whether security is enabled for the current object. COM+ security is enabled unless the object is running in the client's process.


## -parameters






## -returns



If security is enabled for this object, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



In the COM+ environment, server and library applications can use role-based security. <b>IsSecurityEnabled</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> when an application uses role-based security, and role-based security is enabled both for the application and the specific component that called the method. 

<b>MTS 2.0:  </b>In MTS 2.0, this method always returns <b>FALSE</b> when the current object is running in a library application, because MTS library applications cannot use role-based security. However, in the COM+ environment, library applications optionally can use role-based security.
