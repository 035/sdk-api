# IComObjectPoolEvents2::OnObjPoolCreateDecision


## -description


Generated when a pool provides a requesting client with an existing object or creates a new one.


## -parameters




### -param pInfo [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f4aa0892-4c93-42ea-adc6-1b304b917389">COMSVCSEVENTINFO</a> structure.


### -param dwThreadsWaiting [in]

The number of threads waiting for an object.


### -param dwAvail [in]

### -param dwCreated [in]

### -param dwMin [in]

The pool's minimum object value.


### -param dwMax [in]

The pool's maximum object value.


## -returns



The user verifies the return values from this method.




## -remarks



When a component is configured for object pooling, the pool is populated with objects up to the specified minimum level. As client requests for the component come in, they are satisfied on a first-come first-served basis from the pool. If no pooled objects are available and the pool is not yet at its specified maximum level, a new object is created and activated for the client.
