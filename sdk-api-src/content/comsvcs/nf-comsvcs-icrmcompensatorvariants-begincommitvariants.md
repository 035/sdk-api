# ICrmCompensatorVariants::BeginCommitVariants


## -description


Notifies the CRM Compensator of the commit phase (phase two) of the transaction completion and that records are about to be delivered.


## -parameters




### -param bRecovery [in]

Indicates whether this method is being called during recovery.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The CRM Compensator should not depend on any state to be maintained between the prepare phase and the commit phase. The CRM infrastructure is free to release the CRM Compensator between these two phases if it needs to do so. However, state is maintained between the Begin-Record-End calls, and the CRM Compensator always gets the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3309ed58-8161-46f3-93bc-afc0c9bc8d50">ICrmLogControl</a> interface before delivery of any transaction outcome methods.
