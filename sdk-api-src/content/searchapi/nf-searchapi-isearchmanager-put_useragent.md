A user agent is a client application that accesses the Internet. User agents include web browsers, search engine crawlers, download managers, and so on, and may be associated with a specific protocol such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Each user agent typially has a user agent string, such as "Mozilla/4.0", that it can pass to websites and services to identify itself.
