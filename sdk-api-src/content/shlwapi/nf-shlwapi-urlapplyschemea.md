# UrlApplySchemeA function


## -description


Determines a scheme for a specified URL string, and returns a string with an appropriate prefix.


## -parameters




### -param pszIn [in]

Type: <b>PCTSTR</b>

A null-terminated string of maximum length INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH that contains a URL.


### -param pszOut [out]

Type: <b>PTSTR</b>

A pointer to a buffer that, when this function returns successfully, receives a null-terminated string set to the URL specified by <i>pszIn</i> and converted to the standard <i>scheme</i>://<i>URL_string</i> format.


### -param pcchOut [in, out]

Type: <b>DWORD*</b>

The address of a value set to the number of characters in the <i>pszOut</i> buffer. When the function returns, the value depends on whether the function is successful or returns E_POINTER. For other return values, the value of this parameter is meaningless.


### -param dwFlags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The flags that specify how to determine the scheme. The following flags can be combined.



#### URL_APPLY_DEFAULT

Apply the default scheme if <b>UrlApplyScheme</b> can't determine one. The default prefix is stored in the registry but is typically "http".



#### URL_APPLY_GUESSSCHEME

Attempt to determine the scheme by examining <i>pszIn</i>.



#### URL_APPLY_GUESSFILE

Attempt to determine a file URL from <i>pszIn</i>.



#### URL_APPLY_FORCEAPPLY

Force <b>UrlApplyScheme</b> to determine a scheme for pszIn.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns a standard COM return value, including the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A scheme was determined. pszOut points to a string containing the URL with the scheme's prefix. The value of <i>pcchOut</i> is set to the number of characters in the string, not counting the terminating <b>NULL</b> character.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There were no errors, but no prefix was prepended.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_POINTER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The buffer was too small. The value of <i>pcchOut</i> is set to the minimum number of characters that the buffer must be able to contain, including the terminating <b>NULL</b> character.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks



If the URL has a valid scheme, the string will not be modified. However, almost any combination of two or more characters followed by a colon will be parsed as a scheme. Valid characters include some common punctuation marks, such as ".". If your input string fits this description, <b>UrlApplyScheme</b> may treat it as valid and not apply a scheme. To force the function to apply a scheme to a URL, set the <b>URL_APPLY_FORCEAPPLY</b> and <b>URL_APPLY_DEFAULT</b> flags in <i>dwFlags</i>. This combination of flags forces the function to apply a scheme to the URL. Typically, the function will not be able to determine a valid scheme. The second flag guarantees that, if no valid scheme can be determined, the function will apply the default scheme to the URL.
