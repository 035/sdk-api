## -remarks



The performance log is written to the shperf.log file in the Windows directory.  If message performance logs are enabled, the message performance log is written to the msgtrace.log file in the Windows directory. If you call <b>StopWatchFlush</b>, you must have permission to create and modify files in the Windows directory.

Calling <b>StopWatchFlush</b> clears the performance logs after writing them to the shperf.log file.

See the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3db69040-0720-41a3-ba88-db885a2685aa">StopWatchMode</a> function for a description of the information that is recorded in the performance log.
