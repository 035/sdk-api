# UrlUnescapeA function


## -description


Converts escape sequences back into ordinary characters.


## -parameters




### -param pszUrl

TBD


### -param pszUnescaped [out, optional]

Type: <b>PTSTR</b>

A pointer to a buffer that will receive a null-terminated string that contains the unescaped version of <i>pszURL</i>. If <b>URL_UNESCAPE_INPLACE</b> is set in <i>dwFlags</i>, this parameter is ignored.


### -param pcchUnescaped [in, out, optional]

Type: <b>DWORD*</b>

The number of characters in the buffer pointed to by <i>pszUnescaped</i>. On entry, the value <i>pcchUnescaped</i> points to is set to the size of the buffer. If the function returns a success code, the value that <i>pcchUnescaped</i> points to is set to the number of characters written to that buffer, not counting the terminating <b>NULL</b> character. If an E_POINTER error code is returned, the buffer was too small, and the value to which <i>pcchUnescaped</i> points is set to the required number of characters that the buffer must be able to contain. If any other errors are returned, the value to which <i>pcchUnescaped</i> points is undefined.


### -param dwFlags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Flags that control which characters are unescaped. It can be a combination of the following flags.



#### URL_DONT_UNESCAPE_EXTRA_INFO

Do not convert the # or ? character, or any characters following them in the string.



#### URL_UNESCAPE_AS_UTF8

<b>Introduced in WindowsÂ 8</b>. Decode URLs that were encoded by using the <b>URL_ESCAPE_AS_UTF8</b> flag.



#### URL_UNESCAPE_INPLACE

Use <i>pszURL</i> to return the converted string instead of <i>pszUnescaped</i>.


#### - pszURL [in, out]

Type: <b>PTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated string with the URL. If <i>dwFlags</i> is set to <b>URL_UNESCAPE_INPLACE</b>, the converted string is returned through this parameter.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful. If the <b>URL_UNESCAPE_INPLACE</b> flag is not set, the value pointed to by <i>pcchUnescaped</i> will be set to the number of characters in the output buffer pointed to by <i>pszUnescaped</i>. Returns E_POINTER if the <b>URL_UNESCAPE_INPLACE</b> flag is not set and the output buffer is too small. The <i>pcchUnescaped</i> parameter will be set to the required buffer size. Otherwise, returns a standard error value.




## -remarks



An escape sequence has the form "%xy".

Input strings cannot be longer than INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH.
