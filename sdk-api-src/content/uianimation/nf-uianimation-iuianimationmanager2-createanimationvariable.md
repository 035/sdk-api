# IUIAnimationManager2::CreateAnimationVariable


## -description


Creates a new animation variable.


## -parameters




### -param initialValue [in]


               The initial value for the animation variable.


### -param variable [out, retval]


               The new animation variable.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an  <b>HRESULT</b> error code. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/38f15d61-d415-4c7d-b454-5144fc7c9b1e">Windows Animation Error Codes</a> for a list of error codes.




## -remarks



The initial value of an animation variable is specified when the variable is created. After an animation variable is created, its value cannot be changed directly; it must be updated through the animation manager.

An animation variable is typically created to represent each visual characteristic that is to be animated. For example, an application might create two animation variables for the X and Y coordinates of an object that can move freely within a window.
