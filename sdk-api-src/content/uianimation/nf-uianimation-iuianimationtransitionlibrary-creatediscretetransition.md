# IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary::CreateDiscreteTransition


## -description



      Creates a discrete transition.


## -parameters




### -param delay [in]

The amount of time by which to delay the instantaneous switch to the final value.


### -param finalValue [in]


                
             The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.


### -param hold [in]

The amount of time by which to hold the variable at its final value.


### -param transition [out]


               The new discrete transition.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/38f15d61-d415-4c7d-b454-5144fc7c9b1e">Windows Animation Error Codes</a> for a list of error codes.




## -remarks



During a discrete transition, the animation variable remains at the initial value for a specified delay time, then switches instantaneously to a specified final value and remains at that value for a given hold time.

The figure below shows the effect on an animation variable over time during a discrete transition.
