## -description


This function obtains the driver packages (INF files) that are applicable to the specified WDS driver query XML.  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37d96077-d3f0-4372-955d-f8c071d82230">WdsCliFreeStringArray</a> function can be used to free the array of string values allocated by this function. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0E5ABBBD-CD8A-4D0B-9D4B-5044278961D8">WdsCliGetDriverQueryXml</a> function can be used to generate the required driver query XML string.
