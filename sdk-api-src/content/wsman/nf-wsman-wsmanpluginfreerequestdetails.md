# WSManPluginFreeRequestDetails function


## -description


Releases memory that is allocated for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3191f2b3-e754-4f2d-ae8b-11da859c94b7">WSMAN_PLUGIN_REQUEST</a> structure, which is passed into operation plug-in entry points. This method is optional and can be called at any point after a plug-in entry point is called and before the entry point calls the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6cb47762-edfc-48d7-88ec-d62056ea1751">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> method. After this method is called, the memory will be released and the plug-in will be unable to access any of the parameters in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3191f2b3-e754-4f2d-ae8b-11da859c94b7">WSMAN_PLUGIN_REQUEST</a> structure.
