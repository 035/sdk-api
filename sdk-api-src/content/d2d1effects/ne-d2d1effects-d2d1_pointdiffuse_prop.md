# D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP enumeration


## -description



          Identifiers for properties of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/C98A4962-B9EB-4095-9AC4-F1C32C574892">Point-diffuse lighting effect</a>.
        


## -enum-fields




### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_LIGHT_POSITION


            The light position of the point light source. The property is a D2D1_VECTOR_3F defined as (x, y, z). The units are in device-independent pixels (DIPs) and are unbounded.
            

The type is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/469A4FFC-6B5B-4C88-B6A5-23AFD41B885A">D2D1_VECTOR_3F</a>.

The default value is {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}.


### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_DIFFUSE_CONSTANT


            The ratio of diffuse reflection to amount of incoming light. This property must be between 0 and 10,000 and is unitless.
            

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 1.0f.


### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_SURFACE_SCALE


            The scale factor in the Z direction. The surface scale is unitless and must be between 0 and 10,000.
            

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 1.0f.


### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_COLOR


            The color of the incoming light. This property is exposed as a Vector 3 â€“ (R, G, B) and used to compute LR, LG, LB.
            

The type is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/469A4FFC-6B5B-4C88-B6A5-23AFD41B885A">D2D1_VECTOR_3F</a>.

The default value is {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}.


### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_KERNEL_UNIT_LENGTH


            The size of an element in the Sobel kernel used to generate the surface normal in the X and Y direction. This property maps to the dx and dy values in the Sobel gradient. 
            This property is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/DD180090-D2F4-4DF3-8652-101713C01AE4">D2D1_VECTOR_2F</a> (Kernel Unit Length X, Kernel Unit Length Y) and is defined in (DIPs/Kernel Unit). 
            The effect uses bilinear interpolation to scale the bitmap to match size of kernel elements.
            

The type is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/DD180090-D2F4-4DF3-8652-101713C01AE4">D2D1_VECTOR_2F</a>.

The default value is {1.0f, 1.0f}.


### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_SCALE_MODE


            The interpolation mode the effect uses to scale the image to the corresponding kernel unit length. There are six scale modes that range in quality and speed.
            

The type is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/552CCE58-0D79-468C-831D-EBEFE2F87F95">D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_SCALE_MODE</a>.

The default value is D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_SCALE_MODE_LINEAR.


### -field D2D1_POINTDIFFUSE_PROP_FORCE_DWORD
