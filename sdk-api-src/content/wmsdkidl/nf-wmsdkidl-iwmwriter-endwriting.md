# IWMWriter::EndWriting


## -description



The <b>EndWriting</b> method performs tasks required at the end of a writing session. This method flushes the buffers, updates indices and headers, and closes the file. You must call <b>EndWriting</b> when you have finished sending samples to the writer to encode an ASF file.




## -parameters

## -remarks



This method will not return a failure code if the disk space was used up before the encoding was completed. In order to be notified of a file writing error, an application should implement the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a8d8eed8-0a87-40ce-b1bf-2d476c2e4ae3">IWMStatusCallback</a> method and listen for the NS_E_FILE_WRITE event.
