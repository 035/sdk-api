## -remarks



Approval is a mechanism by which your application can approve a device for playback or prohibit it from being used for playback. A typical scenario would be to ask the user whether the device should be used, and to set approval accordingly.

To receive data, a device must be opened, validated, and approved.

You can find out whether the device is open by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5a8a6b2a-6a04-4505-b4be-ec10e1e5effe">IsOpened</a>. To open the device call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451153">Open</a>.

The device is valid only if proximity detection has been performed on it within the past 48 hours. You can check the validity of the device by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce09e6ad-10c0-4cdd-8dee-4faacd958f2b">IsValid</a>. For more information, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0897ad8f-8e06-4de9-840e-1588e0e20c54">IWMProximityDetection</a> interface.

Call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ab90468e-743f-4367-a49b-d494bf9be28f">IsApproved</a> method to determine whether the device is approved. Use <b>Approve</b> to approve or restrict the device.
