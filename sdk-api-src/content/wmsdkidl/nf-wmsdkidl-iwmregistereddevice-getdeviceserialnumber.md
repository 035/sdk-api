The serial number can be any value that can be stored in 128 bits of memory.

Together, the device serial number and the device certificate uniquely identify the device. Manufacturers are encouraged to use a separate certificate for each device. However, a manufacturer may share a certificate between all devices of a particular type, differentiating individual devices by serial number.
