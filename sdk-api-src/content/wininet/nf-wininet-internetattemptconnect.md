# InternetAttemptConnect function


## -description


Attempts to make a connection to the Internet.


## -parameters




### -param dwReserved [in]

This parameter is reserved and must be 0.


## -returns



Returns ERROR_SUCCESS if successful, or a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4a3a8feb-a05f-4614-8f04-1f507da7e5b7">system error code</a> otherwise.




## -remarks



This function allows an application to first attempt to connect before issuing any requests. A client program can use this to evoke the dial-up dialog box. If the attempt fails, the application should enter offline mode.

Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service.  For server implementations or services use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/354ab65d-5e46-451d-b36b-2f8166a1a048">Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)</a>.</div>
