# CMSPStream::ProcessGraphEvent


## -description


The 
<b>ProcessGraphEvent</b> method is called by the MSPCall object to let the stream handle graph events. The default implementation returns S_OK and does nothing. Derived MSPs must override this method if they want to propagate graph events to the application or take some other action in response to graph events.


## -parameters




### -param lEventCode

Implementation-dependent descriptor of the graph event.


### -param lParam1

Implementation-dependent information on the graph event.


### -param lParam2

Implementation-dependent information on the graph event.
