## -remarks



This function retrieves the identifier of the current logical thread under which this physical thread is operating. The current physical thread takes on the logical thread identifier of any client thread that makes a COM call into this application. Similarly, the logical thread identifier of the current physical thread is used to denote the causality for outgoing COM calls from this physical thread.
