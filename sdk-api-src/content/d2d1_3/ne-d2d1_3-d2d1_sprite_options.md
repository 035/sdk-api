# D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS enumeration


## -description


Specifies additional aspects of how a sprite batch is to be drawn, as part of a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/66d049ca-5d4b-1570-3fa3-8991f9fc97a0">ID2D1DeviceContext3::DrawSpriteBatch</a>.


## -enum-fields




### -field D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_NONE

Default value. No special drawing configuration. This option yields the best drawing performance.


### -field D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_CLAMP_TO_SOURCE_RECTANGLE

Interpolation of bitmap pixels will be clamped to the spriteâ€™s source rectangle. 
          If the sub-images in your source bitmap have no pixels separating them, then you may see color bleeding when drawing them with D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_NONE. 
          In that case, consider adding borders between them with your sprite-packing tool, or use this option.
          Note that drawing sprites with this option enabled is slower than using D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_NONE.


### -field D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_FORCE_DWORD
