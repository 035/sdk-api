## -remarks



Currently NTMS_LM_MOUNT requests are sorted using the order number.

The order number set by the 
<b>SetNtmsRequestOrder</b> function is specific to the type of request because the types are processed in a predetermined order. For example, an NTMS_LM_DISMOUNT request is processed prior to an NTMS_LM_MOUNT request. Within a specific class of requests the queue can be ordered, however. The lower ordered requests are processed first; for example, 1 is the first request processed, 2 is the next request processed, and so forth.

To process a request immediately, an application can set the order number to 1. To defer processing, an application should set the order number to a very large number or 0xFFFFFFFF. The order number of a request, which currently has an order number of zero, cannot be changed.
