# IAzApplicationGroup::Submit


## -description


The <b>Submit</b> method persists changes made to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6a15acde-e582-4c49-b7e4-82d4e54012b1">IAzApplicationGroup</a> object.


## -parameters




### -param lFlags [in, optional]

Flags that modify the behavior of the <b>Submit</b> method. The default value is zero. If the AZ_SUBMIT_FLAG_ABORT flag is specified, the changes to the object are discarded and the object is updated to match the underlying policy store.


### -param varReserved [in, optional]

Reserved for future use.


## -remarks



Any additions or modifications to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6a15acde-e582-4c49-b7e4-82d4e54012b1">IAzApplicationGroup</a> object are not persisted until the <b>Submit</b> method is called. 

A created <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6a15acde-e582-4c49-b7e4-82d4e54012b1">IAzApplicationGroup</a> object must be submitted before it can be referenced. The destructor for an object silently discards unsubmitted changes.
