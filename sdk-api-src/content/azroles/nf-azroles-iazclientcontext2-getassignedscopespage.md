### -param PageSize [in]

The number of elements in each page result.


### -param pvarCursor [in, out]

A pointer to a <b>VARIANT</b> that represents the current page of results. For the first call to the  <b>GetAssignedScopesPage</b> method, pass <b>VT_EMPTY</b> as the value for this parameter to retrieve the first page of results. The number of elements on a page is determined by the value of the <i>PageSize</i> parameter. On output, this parameter contains the value to be passed in the next call to <b>GetAssignedScopesPage</b> to retrieve the next page of results. If the value of this parameter on output is <b>EMPTY</b>, there are no more result pages.


### -param pvarScopeNames

On return, contains an array of variables of type <b>VARIANT</b>. Each element of the array is of type <b>VT_BSTR</b> and contains the name of a scope to which the current client is assigned. The number of elements in the array is specified by the <i>PageSize</i> parameter.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce52efc3-92c7-40e4-ac49-0c54049e169f">Common HRESULT Values</a>.




## -remarks



If multiple threads access the same authorization store, a call to the  <b>GetAssignedScopesPage</b> method on one of the threads might not return accurate results if the other thread modifies the store.

In  JScript, the returned <a href="9ec8025b-4763-4526-ab45-390c5d8b3b1e">SAFEARRAY</a> values must be converted to the JScript <a href="08e5f552-0797-4b48-8164-609582fc18c9">Array</a> object.
