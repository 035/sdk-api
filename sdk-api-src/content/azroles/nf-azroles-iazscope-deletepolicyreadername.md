If the domain is not  in the "ExampleDomain\UserName" format, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/72855539-469a-4289-99cc-eae2ed89901f">LookupAccountName</a> function is called to retrieve the domain.

## -remarks



Policy readers for an object can read attributes for the object and for child objects of the object. Readers can also  use the policy; for example, readers can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0bd16cdb-3dba-4656-b264-32e622732155">AccessCheck</a> method. Readers cannot modify the object or its child objects.

To view the list of policy readers in account name format, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4f56ee3f-f987-4569-9e19-c13ab3ff100a">PolicyReadersName</a> property.
