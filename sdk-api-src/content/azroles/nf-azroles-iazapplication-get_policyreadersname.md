## -remarks



Policy readers for an object can read attributes for the object and for child objects of the object. Readers can also  use the policy; for example, readers can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0bd16cdb-3dba-4656-b264-32e622732155">AccessCheck</a> method. Readers cannot modify the object or its child objects.

In JScript, the returned <a href="9ec8025b-4763-4526-ab45-390c5d8b3b1e">SAFEARRAY</a> must be converted to the JScript <a href="08e5f552-0797-4b48-8164-609582fc18c9">Array</a> object.
