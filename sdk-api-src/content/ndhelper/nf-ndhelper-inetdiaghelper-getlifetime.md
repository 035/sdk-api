Helper Class Extensions may return HRESULTS that are specific to the failures encountered in the function.




## -remarks



This method is not required when building a Helper Class Extension.

Lifetime data is used to limit the time scope of a problem instance.  This is particularly useful when doing history-based diagnoses such as tracing and logging where it can be used in scoping down the diagnosis to events that occurred during the specified time interval.

For example, Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) helper classes use lifetime to determine  which filter blocked a packet by checking the trace log. By default, a lifetime of a helper class instance inherits the lifetime of its dependent helper class instance.
