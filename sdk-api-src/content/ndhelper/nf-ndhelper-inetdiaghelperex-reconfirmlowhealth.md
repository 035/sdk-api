# INetDiagHelperEx::ReconfirmLowHealth


## -description


The <b>ReconfirmLowHealth</b> method is used to add a second Low Health pass after hypotheses have been diagnosed and before repairs are retrieved. This method allows the helper class to see the diagnostics results and to change the diagnosis if needed. The method is only called if a diagnosis is not rejected and hypotheses were generated.
