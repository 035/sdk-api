### -param pDeferredTime [out]

A pointer to the time to be deferred, in seconds, if the diagnosis cannot be started immediately. This is used only when the pStatus member is set to <b>DS_DEFERRED</b>.

Helper Class Extensions may return HRESULTS that are specific to the failures encountered in the function.




## -remarks



This method is not required when building a Helper Class Extension.

This method only returns an error code if it encounters failures that impede validation. If necessary, the <i>pStatus</i> parameter is the expected way to communicate that the component is still in low health. <b>DS_REJECTED</b> is used to indicate that the issue has been resolved.
