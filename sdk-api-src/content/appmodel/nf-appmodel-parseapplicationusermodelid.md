### -param packageFamilyName [out, optional]

Type: <b>PWSTR</b>

A pointer to memory space that receives  the package family name string, which includes the null-terminator.

A pointer to a variable that holds the number of characters (<b>WCHAR</b>s) in the package-relative app ID string, which includes the null-terminator. 

First you pass <b>NULL</b> to <i>packageRelativeApplicationId</i> to get the number of characters. You use this number to allocate memory space for <i>packageRelativeApplicationId</i>. Then you pass the address of this memory space to fill <i>packageRelativeApplicationId</i>.


### -param packageRelativeApplicationId [out, optional]

Type: <b>PWSTR</b>

A pointer to memory space that receives  the package-relative app ID (PRAID) string, which includes the null-terminator.
