## -description


Describes the shape of a tile by specifying its dimensions.


## -struct-fields




### -field WidthInTexels

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">UINT</a></b>

The width in texels of the tile.


### -field HeightInTexels

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">UINT</a></b>

The height in texels of the tile.


### -field DepthInTexels

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4553cafc-450e-4493-a4d4-cb6e2f274d46">UINT</a></b>

The depth in texels of the tile.


## -remarks



Texels are equivalent to pixels.  For untyped buffer resources, a texel is just a byte. For multisample antialiasing (MSAA) surfaces, the numbers are still in terms of pixels/texels.
The values here are independent of the surface dimensions.  Even if the surface is smaller than what would fit in a tile, the full tile dimensions are reported here.
