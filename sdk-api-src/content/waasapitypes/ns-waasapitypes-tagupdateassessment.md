# tagUpdateAssessment structure


## -description



<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/157E241E-E8D8-41F8-9565-5C9298DCD1BE">UpdateAssessment</a> contains information that assesses how up-to-date an installed OS is.


## -struct-fields




### -field status

An <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/157E241E-E8D8-41F8-9565-5C9298DCD1BE">UpdateAssessmentStatus</a> enumeration detailing how up-to-date the device is, and for what reason. 


### -field impact

An <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/C7F30B63-66B0-4F37-A05B-7D366A12B640">    UpdateImpactLevel</a> enumeration detailing whether there is any impact on the device if it has an out-of-date OS.


### -field daysOutOfDate

Describes how much time has elapsed since the device has not installed an applicable update. <b>daysOutOfDate</b> is calculated by the current time minus the time since the next applicable update has been released, minus any deferral period. Thus, if an applicable update exists but hasnâ€™t been applied due to deferral, this is accounted for in the calculation. <b>daysOutOfDate</b> is used to calculate the update impact level.


## -remarks



This structure is used most often with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/D76D0587-E31E-48D2-9DF6-33444E4CA325">OSUpdateAssessment</a>, which is in turn used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3123362E-6A1C-49BD-BE9C-0B8506EA944B">GetOSUpdateAssessment</a> method for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/CE5D99C9-2348-4566-AC94-DFBA5B583503">IWaaSAssessor</a>.

When <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3123362E-6A1C-49BD-BE9C-0B8506EA944B">GetOSUpdateAssessment</a> is called, an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/D76D0587-E31E-48D2-9DF6-33444E4CA325">OSUpdateAssessment</a> structure is returned. Within this structure there are two <b>UpdateAssessment</b> structures: <b>assessmentForCurrent</b> and <b>assessmentForUpToDate</b>. The <b>UpdateAssessment</b> structure summarizes the assessments to determine whether a device is current or whether it is up-to-date, respectively; this is defined with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/157E241E-E8D8-41F8-9565-5C9298DCD1BE">UpdateAssessmentStatus</a> enumeration. The assessment informs how many days the device has been out-of-date with <b>daysOutofDate</b>. This date is used to determine if there is any potential impact (represented by the <b>impact</b> member in this structure) to the device.
