# GdiplusAbort structure


## -description


The <b>GdiplusAbort</b> structure provides a mechanism that allows Windows GDI+ to call an application-defined <b>Abort</b> method periodically during time-consuming rendering operations.


## -struct-fields


## -remarks



The <b>GdiplusAbort</b> structure has only one method, a virtual method named <b>Abort</b>. The <b>GdiplusAbort</b> structure has no data members.

To create a callback method, follow these steps.

<ol>
<li>
Create a structure that descends from <b>GdiplusAbort</b>, and implement the following method.

<code>HRESULT __stdcall Abort(void)</code>

</li>
<li>Create data members to hold any data that will be needed by the <b>Abort</b> method.</li>
<li>Pass the address of the <b>GdiplusAbort</b> descendant to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2df54a2c-cb7b-4d65-a27d-7342e00ed71b">Image::SetAbort</a> method.</li>
</ol>
During certain time-consuming rendering operations (for example, a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c9577988-e52f-4f71-ab1b-51bb5368812e">Graphics::DrawImage</a> method), GDI+ calls the <b>Abort</b> method periodically. For some operations the callback is every 250 milliseconds; for other operations the callback is not based on a timer. If the <b>Abort</b> method returns S_OK, GDI+ continues the rendering operation. If the <b>Abort</b> method returns E_ABORT, GDI+ aborts the rendering operation.
