# CFrameworkQuery::GetValuesForProp(LPCWSTR,CHStringArray &)


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/60a7d83c-cfea-41fa-8d97-321127d33c43">CFrameworkQuery</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7F311E1B-5CE6-488D-9411-DE1822D95C3B">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]
<span>The <b>GetValuesForProp</b> method returns all of the values for a particular property that are generated by that property as it appears within the query.

For example, a call to <b>GetValuesForProp</b>(L"Name", sa) returns the array <i>sa</i>, which contains all the values of "Name" that require instances to be sent back to satisfy the query. If <i>sa</i> contains {"a","b"}, then all the instances where "Name=a" plus all the instances where "Name=b" must be sent back to completely satisfy the query.

If the constraints on "Name" are not sufficiently limiting, an empty <i>sa</i> array is returned.
