# _MIB_IPMCAST_IF_TABLE structure


## -description


The 
<b>MIB_IPMCAST_IF_TABLE</b> structure contains a table of IP multicast interface entries.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwNumEntries

Specifies the number of interface entries in the table.


### -field table

A pointer to a table of interface entries implemented as an array of 
<b>MIB_IPMCAST_IF_TABLE</b> structures.


## -remarks



On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista
   and later, the organization of header files has changed. This  structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file, not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i>, which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.
