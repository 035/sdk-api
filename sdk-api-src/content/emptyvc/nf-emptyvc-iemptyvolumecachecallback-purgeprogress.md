## -remarks



This method is typically called by the handler's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c42430da-9d6a-42e9-bc4f-325d986c7c48">Purge</a> method while the handler is purging deletable files. Handlers should call <b>PurgeProgress</b> periodically to keep the user informed of progress, especially if the purge will take a long time. Calling this method frequently also allows the handler to shut down promptly if a user cancels a purge.
