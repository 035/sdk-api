## -remarks



A handler can display a UI, which is typically used to allow the user to select which files are to be cleaned up and how. To do so, the handler sets the <b>EVCF_HASSETTINGS</b> flag in the <i>pdwFlags</i> parameter when <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550945">Initialize</a> is called. The disk cleanup manager will then display a <b>Settings</b> button. When that button is clicked, the disk cleanup manager calls <b>ShowProperties</b> to notify the handler to display its UI.
