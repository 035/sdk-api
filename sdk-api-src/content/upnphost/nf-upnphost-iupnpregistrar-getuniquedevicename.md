# IUPnPRegistrar::GetUniqueDeviceName


## -description


The 
<b>GetUniqueDeviceName</b> method retrieves the UDN for the specified device. The UDN has been generated by the device host for each embedded device. The template UDN in the device description is replaced by this generated UDN for each embedded device when the device is registered. This method is re-entrant.
