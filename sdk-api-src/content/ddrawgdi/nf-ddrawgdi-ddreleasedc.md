# DdReleaseDC function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is subject to change with each operating system revision. Instead, use the Microsoft DirectDraw and Microsoft Direct3DAPIs; these APIs insulate applications from such operating system changes, and hide many other difficulties involved in interacting directly with display drivers.]

<b>GdiEntry8</b> is defined as an alias for this function.
