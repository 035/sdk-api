# IRawCDImageTrackInfo::get_TrackNumber


## -description


Retrieves the track number for this track.


## -parameters




### -param value [out]

The track number for this track.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation.




## -remarks



While this value is often identical to the <b>TrackIndex</b> property, it is possible for pure audio discs to start with a track other than track number 1.  This means that the more general formula is that this value is ( TrackIndex + FirstTrackNumber - 1).

This method is supported in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2),  and Windows Vista  via the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=141659">Windows Feature Pack for Storage</a>. All  features provided by this  update package are supported natively in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
