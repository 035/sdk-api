# IDiscFormat2Data::CancelWrite


## -description


Cancels the current write operation.


## -parameters






## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_IMAPI_DF2DATA_WRITE_NOT_IN_PROGRESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There is no write operation currently in progress.

Value: 0xC0AA0401

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Unspecified failure.

Value: 0x80004005

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



To cancel the write operation, you must call this method from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/786fc936-9493-4cc3-a937-4d1f4b54fe88">DDiscFormat2DataEvents::Update</a> event handler that you implemented. 

Note that calling this method does not immediately cancel the write operation on all media due to media-specific requirements. For example, when writing to a CD, the write operation can continue for up to three more minutes.

This method leaves the media in an indeterminate state. For rewriteable media, you should call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dc71d1bf-b068-42c0-a87d-ae8fac279a58">IDiscFormat2Erase::EraseMedia</a> method after calling this method to prepare the media for future use.
