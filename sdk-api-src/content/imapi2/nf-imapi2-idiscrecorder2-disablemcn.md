## -remarks



MCN is the CD-ROM device driver's method of detecting media change and state changes in the CD-ROM device. For example, when you change the media in a CD-ROM device, a MCN message is sent to trigger media features, such as Autoplay. To disable the features, call this method. 

To enable notifications, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce848ba1-86b4-44cc-8f41-8b8eaba20521">IDiscRecorder2::EnableMcn</a> method. If the application crashes or closes unexpectedly, then MCN is automatically re-enabled by the driver.

Note that DisableMcn increments a reference count each time it is called. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce848ba1-86b4-44cc-8f41-8b8eaba20521">EnableMcn</a> method decrements the count. The device is enabled when the reference count is zero.
