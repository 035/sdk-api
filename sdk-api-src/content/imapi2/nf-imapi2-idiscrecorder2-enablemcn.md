## -remarks



MCN is the CD-ROM device driver's method of detecting media change and state changes in the CD-ROM device. For example, when you change the media in a CD-ROM device, a MCN message is sent to trigger media features, such as Autoplay. MCN is enabled by default. Call this method to enable notifications when the notifications have been disabled using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3111863e-64bf-467c-ac73-7a16c9aeb3df">IDiscRecorder2::DisableMcn</a>.

Note that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3111863e-64bf-467c-ac73-7a16c9aeb3df">DisableMcn</a> increments a reference count each time it is called. The EnableMcn method decrements the count. The device is enabled when the reference count is zero.
