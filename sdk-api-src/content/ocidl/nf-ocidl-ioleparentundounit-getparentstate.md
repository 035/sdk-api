## -parameters




### -param pdwState [out]

A pointer to the state information. This information is a value taken from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cf711180-e38a-4cff-bd2d-2cfca41b376d">UASFLAGS</a> enumeration.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK on success.




## -remarks

If the unit has an open child, it should delegate this method to that child. If not, it should fill in <i>pdwState</i> values appropriately and return. Note that a parent unit must never be blocked while it has an open child. If this happened it could prevent the child unit from being closed, which would cause serious problems.

When checking for a normal state, use the UAS_MASK value to mask unused bits in the <i>pdwState</i> parameter to this method for future compatibility.
