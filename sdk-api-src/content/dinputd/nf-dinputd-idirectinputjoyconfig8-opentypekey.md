Points to the opened registry key, on success.

Points to the name of the type. The name of the type cannot exceed MAX_PATH characters, including the terminating null character. The name cannot begin with a "#" character. Types beginning with "#" are reserved by DirectInput. 


#### - regsam

## -remarks



Control panel applications can use the registry key opened by this method to store per-type persistent information, such as global configuration parameters. Such private information should be kept in a subkey named <b>OEM</b>; do not store private information in the main type key. Control panel applications can also use this key to read configuration information, such as the strings to use for device calibration prompts. The application should use <b>RegCloseKey</b> to close the registry key.
