# IDirectInputJoyConfig8::GetConfig


## -description


The <b>IDirectInputJoyConfig8::GetConfig </b>method obtains information about a joystick's configuration. 


## -parameters




### -param






#### - dwFlags

Specifies the members of the structure pointed to by <i>pjc</i> that are to be filled in.  This parameter can be zero, one, or more of the following: 





#### DIJC_GUIDINSTANCE

Indicates that the instance GUID for the joystick is being requested. An application can pass the instance GUID to <b>IDirectInput::CreateDevice</b> to obtain an <b>IDirectInputDevice</b> interface to the joystick. Note that this flag is not a valid parameter for <b>IDirectInputJoyConfig8::SetConfig</b>. 



#### DIJC_REGHWCONFIGTYPE

Indicates that the hardware configuration for the joystick (the <b>hwc</b> member of the DIJOYCONFIG structure) and the joystick type name (the <b>wszType</b> member of the same structure) are being requested. Note that the hardware configuration and type name cannot be retrieved separately. 



#### DIJC_GAIN

Indicates that the force-feedback gain for the joystick is being requested. 



#### DIJC_CALLOUT

Indicates that the joystick polling callout is being requested. 


#### - pjc

Points to a structure that receives information about the joystick configuration. The caller "must" initialize the <b>dwSize</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538504">DIJOYCONFIG</a> structure before calling this method. 


#### - uiJoy

Indicates a joystick identification number. This is a nonnegative integer. To enumerate joysticks, begin with joystick zero and increment the joystick number by one until the function returns DIERR_NOMOREITEMS. 


## -returns



Returns DI_OK if successful; otherwise, returns one of the following COM error values:
