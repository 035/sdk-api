# IWMPPlayerApplication::switchToControl


## -description

## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td width="60%">

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This method is used only when remoting the Windows Media Player control.

You should avoid keeping a remoted instance of the Player running in the background during times when the control is not in use. Because the remoted Player control instance shares its playback engine with the full mode Player, keeping a background instance running can cause unexpected behavior. For example, the user might close the full mode Player while a file is playing. The user would expect that file playback would completely stop when the Player closes, but audio might continue to play because the playback engine is still active.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This method always returns E_NOTIMPL.
