## -remarks



This method can only be used to set a URL in a security zone that is the same or is less restrictive than the security zone of the calling program or webpage.

Applications that open media items from behind a firewall will have better performance if the address is specified using the domain name server (DNS) name instead of the IP address.

Do not call this method from event handler code as it may yield unexpected results.
