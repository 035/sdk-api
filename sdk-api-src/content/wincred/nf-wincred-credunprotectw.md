The credentials must have been encrypted in the same security context in which <b>CredUnprotect</b> is called.


## -parameters




### -param fAsSelf [in]

Set to <b>TRUE</b> to specify that the credentials were encrypted in the security context of the current process. Set to <b>FALSE</b> to specify that credentials were encrypted in the security context of the calling thread security context.


### -param pszProtectedCredentials [in]

A pointer to a string that specifies the encrypted credentials.


### -param cchProtectedCredentials

TBD


### -param pszCredentials [out]

A pointer to a string that, on output, receives the decrypted credentials.


### -param pcchMaxChars [in, out]

The size, in characters of the <i>pszCredentials</i> buffer. On output, if the <i>pszCredentials</i> is not of sufficient size to receive the encrypted credentials, this parameter specifies the required size, in characters, of the <i>pszCredentials</i> buffer.

The size, in characters, of the <i>pszProtectedCredentials</i> buffer.
