# EMI_CHANNEL_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure


## -description


 The EMI_CHANNEL_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure provides data about the current
        energy measurement and the time at which the measurement was taken for an
        EMI channel.


## -struct-fields




### -field AbsoluteEnergy

The total accumulated energy in units specified by the
                         MeasurementUnit field of the EMI_METADATA_V2 struct
                         returned by IOCTL_EMI_GET_METADATA. In EMI_VERSION_V2,
                         the only supported unit is picowatt-hours.


### -field AbsoluteTime

The time at which the energy measurement was taken in 100ns
                       intervals.
