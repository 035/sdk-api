# SspiEncryptAuthIdentityEx function


## -description


Encrypts a <b>SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_OPAQUE</b> structure. 


## -parameters




### -param Options [in]

Encryption options. This can be one or more of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_ENCRYPT_SAME_LOGON</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The encrypted structure can only be decrypted by a security context in the same logon session. This option is used to protect an identity buffer that is being sent over a local RPC.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_ENCRYPT_SAME_PROCESS</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The encrypted structure can only be decrypted by the same process. Calling the function with this option is equivalent to calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4460f7ec-35fd-4ad1-8c20-dda9f4d3477a">SspiEncryptAuthIdentity</a>. This option is used to protect an identity buffer that is being persisted in a process's private memory for an extended period.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 


### -param AuthData [in, out]

On input, a pointer to an identity buffer to encrypt. This buffer must be prepared for encryption prior to the call to this function. This can be done by calling the function <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4460f7ec-35fd-4ad1-8c20-dda9f4d3477a">SspiEncryptAuthIdentity</a>. On output, the encrypted identity buffer.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, it returns SEC_E_OK.

If the function fails, it returns a nonzero error code.




## -remarks



To transfer credentials securely across processes, applications typically call this function with the SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_ENCRYPT_SAME_LOGON option,  followed by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e43135ad-7fcd-4da6-a4e4-c91c41eeb865">SspiMarshalAuthIdentity</a> to obtain a marshaled authentication buffer and its length. 
For example, Online Identity Credential Provider does this to return the authentication buffer from their <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c5f7ba25-c38a-431a-b4ad-0e2409f763a3">ICredentialProviderCredential::GetSerialization</a> method.
