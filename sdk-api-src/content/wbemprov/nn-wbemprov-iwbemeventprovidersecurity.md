# IWbemEventProviderSecurity interface


## -description


The 
<b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> interface is optionally implemented by event providers who want to restrict consumer access to their event. For more information about when to use this interface, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/86eaeb5c-c27e-4794-88e2-e0ffbb885290">Securing WMI Events</a>.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">

</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">

</td>

</table>Â 


## -remarks



This method is automatically called by Windows Management whenever a new consumer attempts to subscribe to an event where the event provider has implemented 
<b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b>. If the consumer has access permission for the event the consumer is subscribed to the event; otherwise, the subscription is denied.
