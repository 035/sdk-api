# ISyncMgrEvent::GetHandlerID


## -description


Gets the ID of the handler for which the event was logged.


## -parameters




### -param ppszHandlerID [out]

Type: <b>LPWSTR*</b>

When this method returns, contains a pointer to a handler ID as a Unicode string.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The handler ID can have a maximum length of MAX_SYNCMGR_ID, including the terminating null character. The event is expected to allocate the string buffer using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c4cb588d-9482-4f90-a92e-75b604540d5c">CoTaskMemAlloc</a>, which Sync Center uses to deallocate the string buffer.
