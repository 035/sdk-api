# IWMPContentPartner::SetCallback


## -description



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>SetCallback</b> method provides the plug-in with a pointer for calling Windows Media Player methods.




## -parameters




### -param pCallback [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3c66052b-2b82-44aa-868d-5d5a4501c457">IWMPContentPartnerCallback</a> interface.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Windows Media Player calls this function when instantiating the plug-in to provide the callback pointer. The Player also calls this function during shutdown and passes <b>NULL</b> for the parameter value. This signals the plug-in to release the callback pointer provided by the previous call.
