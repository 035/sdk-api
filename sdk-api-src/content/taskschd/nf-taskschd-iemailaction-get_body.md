## -parameters


## -remarks



When setting this property value, the value can be text that is retrieved from a resource .dll file. A specialized string is used to reference the text from the resource file.  The format of the string is $(@ [Dll], [ResourceID]) where [Dll] is the path to the .dll file that contains the resource and [ResourceID] is the identifier for the resource text. For example, the setting this property value to $(@ %SystemRoot%\System32\ResourceName.dll, -101) will set the property to the value of the resource text  with an identifier equal to -101 in the  %SystemRoot%\System32\ResourceName.dll file.
