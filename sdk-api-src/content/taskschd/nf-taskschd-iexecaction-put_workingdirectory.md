## -parameters


## -remarks



When reading or writing XML, the working directory of the application is specified in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/09e53748-6d21-42df-bbdd-f0fd9693aab0">WorkingDirectory</a> element of the Task Scheduler schema.

The path is checked to make sure it is valid when the task is registered, not when this property is set.
