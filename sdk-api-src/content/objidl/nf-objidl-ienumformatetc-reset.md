# IEnumFORMATETC::Reset


## -description


Resets the enumeration sequence to the beginning.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method returns S_OK on success.




## -remarks



There is no guarantee that the same set of objects will be enumerated after the reset operation has completed. A static collection is reset to the beginning, but it can be too expensive for some collections, such as files in a directory, to guarantee this condition.
