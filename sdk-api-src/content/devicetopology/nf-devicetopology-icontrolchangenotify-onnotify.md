# IControlChangeNotify::OnNotify


## -description



The <b>OnNotify</b> method notifies the client when the status of a connector or subunit changes.




## -parameters




### -param dwSenderProcessId [in]


            The process ID of the client that changed the state of the control. If a notification is generated by a hardware event, this process ID will differ from the client's process ID. For more information, see Remarks.
          


### -param pguidEventContext [in]


            A pointer to the context GUID for the control-change event. The client that initiates the control change supplies this GUID. For more information, see Remarks.
          


## -returns




            If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an error code.
          




## -remarks



A client can use this method to keep track of control changes made by other processes and by the hardware. However, a client that changes a control setting can typically disregard the notification that the control change generates. In its implementation of the <b>OnNotify</b> method, a client can inspect the <i>dwSenderProcessId</i> and <i>pguidEventContext</i> parameters to discover whether it or another client is the source of the control-change event.
