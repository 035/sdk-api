# D3D12_TEX2DMS_DSV structure


## -description


Describes the subresource from a multi sampled 2D texture that is accessible to a depth-stencil view.


## -struct-fields




### -field UnusedField_NothingToDefine

Unused.


## -remarks



This structure is a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53161933-5B3B-4B38-AC70-46A4164AE072">D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_VIEW_DESC</a> structure.

Because a multi sampled 2D texture contains a single subresource, there is nothing to specify in <b>D3D12_TEX2DMS_DSV</b>. Consequently, <b>UnusedField_NothingToDefine</b> is included so that this structure will compile in C.
