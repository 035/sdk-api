# D3D12_TEX2DMS_RTV structure


## -description


Describes the subresource from a multi sampled 2D texture to use in a render-target view.


## -struct-fields




### -field UnusedField_NothingToDefine

Integer of any value. See remarks.


## -remarks



This structure is a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/D8602EB9-70EB-4A4E-8D8D-A2016335AAC6">D3D12_RENDER_TARGET_VIEW_DESC</a> structure.

Because a multi sampled 2D texture contains a single subresource, there is actually nothing to specify in <b>D3D12_TEX2DMS_RTV</b>. Consequently, <b>UnusedField_NothingToDefine</b> is included so that this structure will compile in C.
