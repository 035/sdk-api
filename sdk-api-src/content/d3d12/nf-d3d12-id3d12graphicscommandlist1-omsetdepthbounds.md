# ID3D12GraphicsCommandList1::OMSetDepthBounds


## -description


This method enables you to change the depth bounds dynamically.


## -parameters




### -param Min [in]

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh916382.aspx">SAL</a>: <code>_In_</code>

Specifies the minimum depth bounds. The default value is 0. NaN values silently convert to 0.


### -param Max [in]

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh916382.aspx">SAL</a>: <code>_In_</code>

Specifies the maximum depth bounds. The default value is 1. NaN values silently convert to 0.


## -returns



This method does not return a value.




## -remarks



Depth-bounds testing allows pixels and samples to be discarded if the currently-stored depth value is outside the range specified by <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i>, inclusive. If the currently-stored depth value of the pixel or sample is inside this range, then the depth-bounds test passes and it is rendered; otherwise, the depth-bounds test fails and the pixel or sample is discarded. Note that the depth-bounds test considers the currently-stored depth value, not the depth value generated by the executing pixel shader.

To use depth-bounds testing, the application must use the new <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/90557451-CB7A-4F05-8BDB-B611FE034CBB">CreatePipelineState</a> method to enable depth-bounds testing on the PSO and then can use this command list method to change the depth-bounds dynamically.

OMSetDepthBounds is an optional feature. Use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2E986E37-30C7-45FE-BC8B-A6DD5670938F">CheckFeatureSupport</a> method to determine whether or not this feature is supported by the user-mode driver. Support for this feature is reported through the <a href="direct3d12.d3d12_feature_d3d12_options1">D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS1</a> structure.
