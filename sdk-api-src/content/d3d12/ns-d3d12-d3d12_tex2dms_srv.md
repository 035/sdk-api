# D3D12_TEX2DMS_SRV structure


## -description


Describes the subresources from a multi sampled 2D texture to use in a shader-resource view.


## -struct-fields




### -field UnusedField_NothingToDefine

Integer of any value. See remarks.


## -remarks



This structure is a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2B4B868F-3E9F-4570-B1C7-2767ED717A3B">D3D12_SHADER_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC</a> structure.

Since a multi sampled 2D texture contains a single subresource, there is actually nothing to specify in <b>D3D12_TEX2DMS_SRV</b>. Consequently, <b>UnusedField_NothingToDefine</b> is included so that this structure will compile in C.
