# IAudioEndpointRT::ProcessingComplete


## -description



        The <b>ProcessingComplete</b> method notifies the endpoint that a processing pass has been completed.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method does not return a value.




## -remarks



This method enables the audio engine to call into the endpoint to set an event that indicates
    that a processing pass had been completed and that there is audio data ready to be retrieved or passed to
    the endpoint device.

This method can be called from a real-time processing thread. The
    implementation of this method must not block, access
    paged memory, or call any blocking system routines.

The Remote Desktop Services AudioEndpoint API is for use in Remote Desktop scenarios; it is not for client applications.
