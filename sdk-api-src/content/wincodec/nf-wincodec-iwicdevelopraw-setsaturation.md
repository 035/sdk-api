Sets the saturation value of the raw image.


## -parameters




### -param Saturation [in]

Type: <b>double</b>

The saturation value of the raw image. The value range for saturation is 0.0 through 1.0. A value of 0.0 represents an image with a fully de-saturated image, while a value of 1.0 represents the highest amount of saturation that can be applied.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The codec implementer must determine what the upper range value represents and must determine how to map the value to their image processing routines.
