## -remarks



The <b>SetTextContext</b> function provides context for a phrase or a word, increasing your recognizer's accuracy. For example, if the <i>pwcBefore</i><i>pwcBefore</i> string is "under the " and the <i>pwcAfter</i> string is "in the house", you can bias your recognizer using a word or words between the strings. Your recognizer should consider the space after "the" and before "in" when performing the recognition.

However, if the <i>pwcAfter</i> string is "Hel" and the <i>pwcBefore</i> string is "o", the lack of space between the strings indicates the recognizer should recognize one or more letters inside a word that begins with "Hel" and ends with "o".

It is recommended that you limit the length of the text context to no more than 1024 characters each for the left and right contexts.
