# IInkCursorButton::get_Name


## -description



Gets the name of the object.



This property is read-only.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Accessing this property within certain message handlers can result in the underlying function being re-entered, causing unexpected results. Take care to avoid a reentrant call when handling any of the following messages: <b>WM_ACTIVATE</b>, <b>WM_ACTIVATEAPP</b>, <b>WM_NCACTIVATE</b>, WM_PAINT; <b>WM_SYSCOMMAND</b> if <i>wParam</i> is set to SC_HOTKEY or SC_TASKLIST; and <b>WM_SYSKEYDOWN</b> (when processing Alt-Tab or Alt-Esc key combinations). This is an issue with single-threaded apartment model applications.
