# IInkExtendedProperty interface


## -description



Represents the ability to add your own data to a variety of objects within the Tablet PC object model.




## -remarks



Extended properties are application-defined data that can be of whatever form the application requires. The name of the extended property is expressed as a globally unique identifier (GUID).

If you define a class that implements this interface, the new class will not interact correctly with the Tablet PC application programming interfaces (APIs).
