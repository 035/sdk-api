# IInkDrawingAttributes::put_FitToCurve


## -description



Gets or sets the value that specifies whether Bezier smoothing is used to render ink.



This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Bezier smoothing renders ink as a series of curves instead of as lines between pen sample points. Rendering ink as a series of curves is useful for smoothing the ink, especially when the person writing the ink has unsteady writing.

If you set this property while collecting a stroke or strokes, the ink does not render as a series of curves until it is redrawn or refreshed.
