For a complete list of hardware capability values that you can use, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ab8dfca3-df5e-40a7-9da2-d19447bc746b">TabletHardwareCapabilities</a> enumeration type.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Accessing this property within certain message handlers can result in the underlying function being re-entered, causing unexpected results. Take care to avoid a reentrant call when handling any of the following messages: WM_ACTIVATE, WM_ACTIVATEAPP, WMNCACTIVATE, WM_PAINT; WM_SYSCOMMAND if <b>wParam</b> is set to SC_HOTKEY or SC_TASKLIST; and WM_SYSKEYDOWN (when processing Alt-Tab or Alt-Esc key combinations).
