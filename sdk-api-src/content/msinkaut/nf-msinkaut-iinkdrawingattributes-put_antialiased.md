# IInkDrawingAttributes::put_AntiAliased


## -description



Gets or sets the value that indicates whether a stroke is antialiased.



This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



If a stroke is antialiased, the foreground and background colors along the edge of the ink are blended to increase the visible smoothness.

Antialiasing improves the quality of rendering by making ink appear smoother and sharper, especially on lower resolution displays. However, antialiasing incurs added performance. Use it judiciously.
