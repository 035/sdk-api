# IXpsOMSignatureBlockResource::SetContent


## -description


Sets the read-only stream to be associated with this resource.


## -parameters




### -param sourceStream [in]

The read-only stream to be associated with this resource.


### -param partName [in]

The part name to be assigned to this resource.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK; otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The calling method  should treat this stream as a single-threaded apartment (STA) model object and not re-enter any of the stream interface's methods.

Because <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1e6c53fa-7180-454d-8bdc-332eb0d3fa27">GetStream</a> gets a clone of  the stream that is set by this method, the provided stream should have an efficient cloning method. A stream with an inefficient cloning method will reduce the performance of <b>GetStream</b>.
