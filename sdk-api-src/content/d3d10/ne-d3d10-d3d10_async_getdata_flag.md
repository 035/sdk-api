# D3D10_ASYNC_GETDATA_FLAG enumeration


## -description


Optional flags that control the behavior of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f8993ac8-3632-48d0-a583-08f117e8f587">ID3D10Asynchronous::GetData</a>.


## -enum-fields




### -field D3D10_ASYNC_GETDATA_DONOTFLUSH

Do not flush the command buffer. This can potentially cause an infinite loop if GetData is continually called until it returns S_OK as there may still be commands in the command buffer that need to be processed in order for GetData to return S_OK. Since the commands in the command buffer are not flushed they will not be processed and therefore GetData will never return S_OK.
