# ID3D10Multithread::Enter


## -description


Enter a device's critical section.


## -parameters






## -returns



Returns nothing.




## -remarks



Entering a device's critical section prevents other threads from simultaneously calling that device's methods (if <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6023a211-f493-4d2d-b9ff-1208c44d0d8f">multithread protection</a> is set to true), calling DXGI methods, and calling the methods of all resource, view, shader, state, and asynchronous interfaces.

This function should be used in multithreaded applications when there is a series of graphics commands that must happen in order. This function is typically called at the beginning of the series of graphics commands, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/739a4659-55db-409c-b67f-9114c205df03">ID3D10Multithread::Leave</a> is typically called after those graphics commands.
