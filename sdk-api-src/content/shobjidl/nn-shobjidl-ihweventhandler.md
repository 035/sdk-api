# IHWEventHandler interface


## -description


Called by AutoPlay to implement the handling of registered media types.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IHWEventHandler</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IHWEventHandler</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IHWEventHandler</b> interface has these methods.

## -remarks



Developers supporting this interface must expose it in a Component Object Model (COM) server.

All applications registered as AutoPlay media handlers must implement this interface. Handlers that implement this interface should return quickly from calls to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/575ca84c-8cf9-4ed6-a997-844cf0533986">IHWEventHandler::HandleEvent</a> and  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/65720250-ace5-488d-9be7-33b07d7cc667">IHWEventHandler2::HandleEventWithHWND</a> so they won't block the AutoPlay dialog from closing. Additionally, if a local server must be launched for the creation of this handler, it should not block the CreateInstance call; it should return as soon as possible.
