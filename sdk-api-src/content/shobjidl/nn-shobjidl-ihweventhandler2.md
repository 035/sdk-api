# IHWEventHandler2 interface


## -description


Extends the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/be49322a-99b2-4626-8e9d-29965bbe182d">IHWEventHandler</a> interface to address User Account Control (UAC) elevation for device handlers.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IHWEventHandler2</b> interface inherits from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/be49322a-99b2-4626-8e9d-29965bbe182d">IHWEventHandler</a>. <b>IHWEventHandler2</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IHWEventHandler2</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="37%">Method</th>
<th align="left" width="63%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/65720250-ace5-488d-9be7-33b07d7cc667">HandleEventWithHWND</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Handles AutoPlay device events that contain content types that the application is not registered to handle. This method provides a handle to the owner window so that UI can be displayed if the process requires elevated privileges.

</td>
</tr>

## -remarks



This interface also provides the methods of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/be49322a-99b2-4626-8e9d-29965bbe182d">IHWEventHandler</a> interface, from which it inherits.

Handlers that implement this interface should return quickly from calls to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/575ca84c-8cf9-4ed6-a997-844cf0533986">IHWEventHandler::HandleEvent</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/65720250-ace5-488d-9be7-33b07d7cc667">IHWEventHandler2::HandleEventWithHWND</a> so they do not block the AutoPlay dialog from closing. Also, if a local server must be launched for the creation of this handler, it should not block the CreateInstance call; it should return as soon as possible.
