## -remarks



Some stream events may be received after streaming has been stopped due to delayed transmission.

Successfully unselecting the last terminal from a stream effectively ceases any existing streaming for this particular stream. Subsequently selecting the same terminal or another terminal restarts such interrupted streaming.

Reselection onto a stream with a different terminal, or a newly created one, can have unexpected effects. The filter graph may retain information from the previous terminal that fails to match the new one.
