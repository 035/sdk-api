# DXGIDeclareAdapterRemovalSupport function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

Allows a process to indicate that it's resilient to any of its graphics devices being removed.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns <b>S_OK</b> if successful; an error code otherwise. If this function is called after device creation, it returns <b>DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL</b>. If this is not the first time that this function is called, it returns <b>DXGI_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS</b>. For a full list of error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9aa7dd65-6bf9-4731-8085-a9eab4224cdd">DXGI_ERROR</a>.




## -remarks



This function is graphics API-agonistic, meaning that apps running on other APIs, such as OpenGL and Vulkan, would also apply.

This function should be called once per process and before any device creation.
