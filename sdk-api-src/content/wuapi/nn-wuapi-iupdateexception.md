# IUpdateException interface


## -description


Represents info about the aspects of search results returned in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f38c5b0f-8010-4db1-802c-5005c332188b">ISearchResult</a> object that were incomplete. For more info, see Remarks.


## -remarks



The <b>IUpdateException</b> object is returned as part of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a341676e-75b3-46e5-8c55-b070147d4277">ISearchResult::Warnings</a> property when a search succeeds but can't return complete results. For example, Windows Update might not have been able to retrieve all of the update metadata for a given update from the server. In this situation, the search results returned in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f38c5b0f-8010-4db1-802c-5005c332188b">ISearchResult</a> object are usable, but they aren't necessarily complete. The properties of the <b>IUpdateException</b> objects that are returned by the <b>ISearchResult::Warnings</b> property contain info about the  aspects of the search that were incomplete. This info is unlikely to be useful programmatically, but can sometimes be useful for debugging.
