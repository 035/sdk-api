# NPGetUser function


## -description


Retrieves the value of the current default user name or the user name used to establish a network connection.


## -parameters




### -param lpName [in]

Pointer to the name of the local device the caller is interested in, or a remote name for a resource that the user has made a connection to. This parameter may be <b>NULL</b> or the empty string if the caller is interested in the name of the user currently logged on to the system. If a remote name for a resource is passed in, and the user is connected to that resource using different names, it is possible that a provider cannot resolve which user name to return. In this case the provider may make an arbitrary choice amongst the possible user names.


### -param lpUserName [out]

Pointer to a buffer to receive the user name. This should be a name that can be passed into the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37a3988c-18ee-400a-85c3-cc3cbdf015ea">NPAddConnection</a> or 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b0d730f7-595e-4ea7-8688-db479dcc40b4">NPAddConnection3</a> function to re-establish the connection with the same user name.


### -param lpnBufferLen

TBD




#### - lpBufferSize [in, out]

Pointer to the size, in characters, of the <i>lpUserName</i> buffer. If the call fails because the buffer is not big enough, this location will be used to return the required buffer size.
