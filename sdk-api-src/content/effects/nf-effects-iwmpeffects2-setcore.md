# IWMPEffects2::SetCore


## -description



The <b>SetCore</b> method is called by Windows Media Player to provide visualization access to the core Windows Media Player APIs.




## -parameters




### -param pPlayer [in]

Pointer to an <b>IWMPCore</b> interface.


## -returns



This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.




## -remarks



You can use this method to set or release a pointer to the <b>IWMPCore</b> interface. If <i>pPlayer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the visualization is being shut down and all stored references to the core should be released.

This method is not called when Windows Media Player instantiates the visualization for the purpose of displaying its property page. This method can therefore be used as an entry point that will only be called when the visualization is enabled and Windows Media Player loads it normally.
