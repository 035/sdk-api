# IWMPEffects::GetTitle


## -description



The <b>GetTitle</b> method gets the display title of the visualization.




## -parameters




### -param bstrTitle [out]

<b>String</b> containing the title.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method allows the application to show the user a title when the visualization itself is displayed. The title should be as unique as possible. Do not use titles of visualizations included with the Windows Media Player as this will cause confusion to the user.
