## -description


The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/01547e07-19a6-4441-aa33-43f54e7109cc">CustomLineCap</a> class encapsulates a custom line cap. A line cap defines the style of graphic used to draw the ends of a line. It can be various shapes, such as a square, circle, or diamond. A custom line cap is defined by the path that draws it. The path is drawn by using a 
			<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b48affa5-d953-478c-b651-0534db4d2b78">Pen</a>object to draw the outline of a shape or by using a 
			<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37cfc0f8-8e17-4944-85fc-cc80ebff13df">Brush</a>object to fill the interior. The cap can be used on either or both ends of the line. Spacing can be adjusted between the end caps and the line.
