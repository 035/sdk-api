# Font class


## -description


The <b>Font</b> class encapsulates the characteristics, such as family, height, size, and style (or combination of styles), of a specific font. A <b>Font</b> object is used when drawing strings. 


## -remarks



When using GDI+ API, you must never allow your application to download arbitrary fonts from untrusted sources. 
The operating system requires elevated privileges to assure that all installed fonts are trusted.
