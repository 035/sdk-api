## -parameters




### -param ppAsync [out]

Doubly indirect pointer to an 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d2cff547-b4ff-454d-8e0e-cd29b91cbb07">IVssAsync</a> object containing status data for the signaled event.


## -returns



The following are the valid return codes for this method.

## -remarks



The caller is responsible for releasing the 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d2cff547-b4ff-454d-8e0e-cd29b91cbb07">IVssAsync</a> interface pointer.

Special consideration should be given to EFI systems when the requester has selected the Automated System Recovery (ASR) writer for restore.  If you are restoring to a disk that contains the EFI partition, and one of the following conditions exists, you must first clean the disk by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4052f294-d911-44c6-a57f-0a0a6f24df70">IVdsAdvancedDisk::Clean</a> method:

<ul>
<li>You are restoring to an EFI system disk whose partitioning has changed since the last ASR backup.</li>
<li>You are restoring to a different physical drive than the one from which the backup was taken.</li>
</ul>
Failure to perform this disk-cleaning step may result in unexpected results during <a href="vssgloss_p.htm">PreRestore</a>.

For more information about the ASR writer, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e20a303d-9440-42be-b383-85f6fad89157">In-Box VSS Writers</a>.
