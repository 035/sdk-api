# DeleteLogByHandle function


## -description


Marks the specified log for deletion. The log is actually deleted when all handles, marshaling areas, and read contexts to the log are closed.  If the log is a physical log, its underlying containers are deleted.

When a log is marked for deletion, requests to open new client log streams fail.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This function differs from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a7dd8efc-b572-4591-9e46-1cd5105d4ca2">DeleteLogFile</a>, because it takes a valid open handle to the log object instead of the log name.</div><div> </div>
