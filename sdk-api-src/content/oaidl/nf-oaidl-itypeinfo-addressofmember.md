## -remarks



The addresses are valid until the caller releases its reference to the type description. The <i>invKind</i> parameter can be ignored unless the address of a property function is being requested.

If the type description inherits from another type description, this function is recursive to the base type description, if necessary, to find the item with the requested member ID.
