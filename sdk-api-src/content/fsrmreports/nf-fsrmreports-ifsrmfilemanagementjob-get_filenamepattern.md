## -remarks



A file name pattern is a string expression that defines a set of file names. The expression may contain the 
    following wildcard characters: "*" and "?". The "*" wildcard 
    matches zero or more characters and the "?" wildcard  matches exactly 1 character. For example, 
    the file name "example.cpp" matches the pattern "e*.cpp", but not "e?.cpp". The file name "ex.cpp" would match 
    both patterns. Note that when the file name pattern is used to compare against a specific file name, the pattern 
    match is case-insensitive.
