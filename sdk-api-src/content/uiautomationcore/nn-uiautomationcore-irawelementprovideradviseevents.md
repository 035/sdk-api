# IRawElementProviderAdviseEvents interface


## -description


Exposes methods that are called to notify the root element of a fragment 
		when a Microsoft UI Automation client application begins or ends listening for events on that fragment.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IRawElementProviderAdviseEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IRawElementProviderAdviseEvents</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IRawElementProviderAdviseEvents</b> interface has these methods.

## -remarks



Implementation of this interface is optional. It can be used to improve performance by raising events only when they are being listened for.
	

Similar to implementing reference counting in Component Object Model (COM) programming, it is important for UI Automation providers to treat the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b5902d9b-e008-4b91-933e-82506718eecd">AdviseEventAdded</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/42c9aeeb-dc08-4c13-ae86-2c0fb93e5c17">AdviseEventRemoved</a> methods like the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b4316efd-73d4-4995-b898-8025a316ba63">AddRef</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4b494c6f-f0ee-4c35-ae45-ed956f40dc7a">Release</a> methods of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface.
As long as <b>AdviseEventAdded</b> has been called more times than <b>AdviseEventRemoved</b> for a specific event or property, the provider should continue to raise corresponding events, because some clients are still listening. Alternatively, UI Automation providers can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/66b5d6b9-b51a-4848-b6e4-bd4c73b07f18">UiaClientsAreListening</a> function to determine if at least one client is listening and, if so, raise all appropriate events.
