# IX509Enrollment::get_Certificate


## -description


The <b>Certificate</b> property retrieves the installed certificate. The certificate is contained in a byte array that is encoded by using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d007cbb9-b547-4dc7-bc22-b526f650f7c2">Distinguished Encoding Rules</a> (DER) as defined by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0baaa937-f635-4500-8dcd-9dbbd6f4cd02">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) standard.  The DER-encoded byte array is represented by a string that is  either a pure binary sequence or Unicode encoded.
