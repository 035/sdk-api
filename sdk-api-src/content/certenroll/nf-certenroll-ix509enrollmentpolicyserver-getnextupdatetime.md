## -remarks



The date is stored as an 8-byte real value that represents a Coordinated Universal Time (Greenwich Mean Time) value between January 1, 1900 and December 31, 9999, inclusive. The value 2.0 represents January 1, 1900; 3.0 represents January 2, 1900. Adding 1 to the value increments the date by a day. The fractional part of the value represents the time of day. Therefore, 2.5 represents 12:00 on January 1, 1900; 3.25 represents 06:00 on January 2, 1900.
