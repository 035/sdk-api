# IX509SignatureInformation::get_NullSigned


## -description


The <b>NullSigned</b> property specifies and retrieves a Boolean value that indicates whether the certificate request is null-signed.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



A null-signed certificate request is not really signed. That is, the request can be digested by using a digest algorithm such as SHA-1, but it is not encrypted with a public key algorithm such as RSA. You must set this property before calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e5b43e74-d802-43ff-bdf2-96ab475c31e7">GetSignatureAlgorithm</a> method.
