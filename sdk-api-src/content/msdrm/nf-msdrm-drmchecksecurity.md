# DRMCheckSecurity function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The AD RMS SDK leveraging functionality exposed by 

the client in Msdrm.dll is available for use in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8. It may be altered or 

unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a7900f40-4c53-4760-8e5a-9c88149f86d0">Active Directory Rights Management Services SDK 2.1</a>,

## -parameters




### -param hEnv [in]

A handle to an environment.


### -param cLevel [in]

Level of the security check to run, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most secure but most resource-intensive.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the function returns <b>S_OK</b>.

If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce52efc3-92c7-40e4-ac49-0c54049e169f">Common HRESULT Values</a>.




## -remarks
