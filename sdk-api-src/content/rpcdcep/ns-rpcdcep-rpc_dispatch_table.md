# RPC_DISPATCH_TABLE structure


## -description


The 
<b>RPC_DISPATCH_TABLE</b> structure is part of the private interface between the run-time libraries and the stubs. Most distributed applications that use Microsoft RPC do not need this structure.

The structure is defined in the header file Rpcdcep.h. See the header file for syntax block and member definitions.
