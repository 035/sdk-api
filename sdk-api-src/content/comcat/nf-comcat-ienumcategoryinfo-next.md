# IEnumCATEGORYINFO::Next


## -description


Retrieves the specified number of items in the enumeration sequence.


## -parameters




### -param celt [in]

The number of items to be retrieved. If there are fewer than the requested number of items left in the sequence, this method retrieves the remaining elements.


### -param rgelt [out]

An array of enumerated items.

The enumerator is responsible for allocating any memory, and the caller is responsible for freeing it. If <i>celt</i> is greater than 1, the caller must also pass a non-NULL pointer passed to <i>pceltFetched</i> to know how many pointers to release.


### -param pceltFetched [out]

The number of items that were retrieved. This parameter is always less than or equal to the number of items requested.


## -returns



If the method retrieves the number of items requested, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is S_FALSE.
