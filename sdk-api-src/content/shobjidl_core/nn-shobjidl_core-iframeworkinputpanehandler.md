# IFrameworkInputPaneHandler interface


## -description


Enables an app to be notified when the input pane (the on-screen keyboard or handwriting panel) is being shown or hidden. This allows the app window to adjust its display so that no input areas (such as a text box) are obscured by the input pane.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IFrameworkInputPaneHandler</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IFrameworkInputPaneHandler</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Called before the input pane is shown, to allow the app window to make any necessary adjustments to its UI in response to the reduced screen space available to it. This is particularly important for input elements, such as text boxes, that are used in conjunction with the input pane.
