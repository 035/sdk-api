### -param psink [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/70866a03-2b22-4518-a9e6-2f06edaa4b5d">ITransferAdviseSink</a>*</b>

A pointer to notification interface <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/70866a03-2b22-4518-a9e6-2f06edaa4b5d">ITransferAdviseSink</a> to update the calling application using methods on this interface.


### -param pdwCookie [out]

Type: <b>DWORD*</b>

A pointer to a returned token that uniquely identifies this connection. The calling application uses this token later to delete the connection by passing it to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4f71134e-dfbf-40e7-b72b-c4913c876689">ITransferSource::Unadvise</a> method. If the connection was not successfully established, this value is zero.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

## -remarks



Call <b>ITransferSource::Advise</b> before calling any other methods in this interface to enable an advisory session. If not set, the handler should consider it an indication that no feedback is available and to do the "default" operation without consulting the calling application.
