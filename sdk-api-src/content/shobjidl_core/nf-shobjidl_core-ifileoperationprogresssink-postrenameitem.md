# IFileOperationProgressSink::PostRenameItem


## -description


Performs caller-implemented actions after the rename process for each item is complete.


## -parameters




### -param dwFlags [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

bitwise value that contains flags that were used during the rename operation. Some values can be set or changed during the rename operation. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8a3da00a-1d96-444d-acbe-9327620b8d24">TRANSFER_SOURCE_FLAGS</a> for flag descriptions.


### -param psiItem [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/599b9c0a-df04-4dbd-a5a6-a8736eecc560">IShellItem</a>*</b>

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/599b9c0a-df04-4dbd-a5a6-a8736eecc560">IShellItem</a> that specifies the item before it was renamed.


### -param pszNewName [in]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

Pointer to the new <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9b159be9-3797-4c8b-90f8-9d3b3a3afb71">display name</a> of the item. This is a null-terminated, Unicode string. Note that this might not be the name that you asked for, given collisions and other naming rules.


### -param hrRename [in]

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

The return value of the rename operation. Note that this is not the HRESULT returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2f72b729-3535-4ab7-9579-21b1ba97c67f">RenameItem</a>, which simply queues the rename operation. Instead, this is the result of the actual rename operation.


### -param psiNewlyCreated [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/599b9c0a-df04-4dbd-a5a6-a8736eecc560">IShellItem</a>*</b>

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/599b9c0a-df04-4dbd-a5a6-a8736eecc560">IShellItem</a> that represents the item with its new name.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or an error value otherwise. In the case of an error value, all subsequent operations pending from the call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6596607e-0699-4eb6-b0d6-7cc2e5eb49c7">IFileOperation</a> are canceled.
