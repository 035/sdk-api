# IObjectWithSelection::GetSelection


## -description


Gets the Shell item array that contains the selected items.


## -parameters




### -param riid [in]

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

A reference to the IID of the interface to retrieve through <i>ppv</i>, typically IID_IShellItemArray.


### -param ppv [out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

When this method returns successfully, contains the interface pointer requested in <i>riid</i>. This is typically an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/348213d1-c03f-4c38-9d13-3b1009d94e07">IShellItemArray</a>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



We recommend that you use the <b>IID_PPV_ARGS</b> macro, defined in Objbase.h, to package the <i>riid</i> and <i>ppv</i> parameters. This macro provides the correct IID based on the interface pointed to by the value in <i>ppv</i>, which eliminates the possibility of a coding error in <i>riid</i> that could lead to unexpected results.
