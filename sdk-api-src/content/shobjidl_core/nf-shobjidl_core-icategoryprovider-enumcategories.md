# ICategoryProvider::EnumCategories


## -description


Gets the enumerator for the list of GUIDs that represent categories.


## -parameters




### -param penum [out]

Type: <b>IEnumGUID**</b>

When this method returns, contains the address of a pointer to an <b>IEnumGUID</b> interface that specifies a list of GUIDs that represent categories.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



In the case of the system folder view object, <b>ICategoryProvider::EnumCategories</b> is used to obtain additional categories that are not associated with a column. When the list of category GUIDs is returned through <i>penum</i>, the UI attempts to retrieve the name of each category. That name is then displayed as a category choice. In the case of WindowsÂ XP, that choice appears in the folder's <b>Arrange Icons By</b> menu.
