# IApplicationDesignModeSettings::TriggerEdgeGesture


## -description


Sends a spoofed edge gesture event to the proxy core window on the caller's thread. This gesture toggles the app's app bar, if the app supports one. The caller can specify the type of input that triggered the edge gesture.

You must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/429E5D12-9ED9-4f4f-A0E6-F95953C9113A">IInitializeWithWindow::Initialize</a> to set a proxy core window before calling this method.


## -parameters




### -param edgeGestureKind [in]

Indicates the <b>EDGE_GESTURE_KIND</b> input type that generated the spoofed edge gesture. If touch (<b>EGK_TOUCH</b>) is specified, both the <b>Starting</b> and <b>Completed</b> edge gesture events are sent. Otherwise, only the <b>Completed</b> event is sent. One of the following values:



#### EGK_TOUCH (0)

The edge gesture event was generated by a swipe on a touch-enabled screen.



#### EGK_KEYBOARD (1)

The edge gesture event was generated by the Win+Z key sequence on the keyboard.



#### EGK_MOUSE (2)

The edge gesture event was generated by a right mouse click.
