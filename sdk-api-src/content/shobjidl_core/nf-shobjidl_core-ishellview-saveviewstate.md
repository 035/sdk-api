# IShellView::SaveViewState


## -description


Saves the Shell's view settings so the current state can be restored during a subsequent browsing session.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or a COM-defined error value otherwise.




## -remarks



The Shell view obtains a view stream by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/887ebe9f-8bde-46dd-a7a2-7b2ca66bf905">GetViewStateStream</a> method and stores the current view state in that stream.

<h3><a id="Note_to_Calling_Applications"></a><a id="note_to_calling_applications"></a><a id="NOTE_TO_CALLING_APPLICATIONS"></a>Note to Calling Applications</h3>
Windows Explorer calls this method when it wants to save the view state for a view.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Implementers"></a><a id="notes_to_implementers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_IMPLEMENTERS"></a>Notes to Implementers</h3>
Be sure to make the format of the data stored in the stream robust enough that different versions of the implementation can read it without error.
