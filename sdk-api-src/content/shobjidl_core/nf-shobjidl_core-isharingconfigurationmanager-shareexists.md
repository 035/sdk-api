# ISharingConfigurationManager::ShareExists


## -description


Queries whether the <b>Users</b> or <b>Public</b> folder is shared.


## -parameters




### -param dsid [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/02d3b664-eeef-4214-99e8-246241103c4e">DEF_SHARE_ID</a></b>

One of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/02d3b664-eeef-4214-99e8-246241103c4e">DEF_SHARE_ID</a> values that indicates the folder whose sharing state is being checked.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

S_OK if the folder is shared; otherwise, S_FALSE.




## -remarks



Because as of WindowsÂ 7 <b>Public</b> is shared in-place through <b>Users</b>, callers should always check for the Users share first. If a share is found to exist on <b>Users</b>, then it follows that a share exists on <b>Public</b> as well.
