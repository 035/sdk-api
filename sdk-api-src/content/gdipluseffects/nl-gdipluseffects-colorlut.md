# ColorLUT class


## -description


A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6ae866ac-6335-428a-bb11-ec793b69c2b7">ColorLUTParams</a> structure has four members, each being a lookup table for a particular color channel: alpha, red, green, or blue. The lookup tables can be used to make custom color adjustments to bitmaps. Each lookup table is an array of 256 bytes that you can set to values of your choice. After you have initialized a <b>ColorLUTParams</b> structure, pass its address to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/94f35947-7e62-4f47-b21a-ed3939a4f36f">ColorLUT::SetParameters</a> method of a <b>ColorLUT</b> object. Then pass the address of that <b>ColorLUT</b> object to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cb85a7ac-5af0-45c7-8035-d7bc2827af6a">Graphics::DrawImage</a> method or to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6b3d0a2f-acff-47a7-bc9f-6e9d659f683c">Bitmap::ApplyEffect</a> method.
