# IWMSInternalAdminNetSource::GetCredentials


## -description



The <b>GetCredentials</b> method retrieves a cached password.



This method has been superseded by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e351f403-4699-4666-b98f-2aed0b80e548">IWMSInternalAdminNetSource3::GetCredentialsEx2</a>. The methods of <b>IWMSInternalAdminNetSource3</b> are much more secure than the password caching methods in <b>IWMSInternalAdminNetSource</b> and should be used if available.


## -parameters




### -param bstrRealm [in]

String containing the realm name. Realm names are supplied by servers to distinguish different levels of access to their files. Not all servers have realm names, in which case the DNS name is used.


### -param pbstrName [out]

Pointer to a string containing the user name.


### -param pbstrPassword [out]

Pointer to a string containing the password.


### -param pfConfirmedGood [out]

Pointer to a Boolean value that is set to True if the password was cached after it was confirmed as correct by the server.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.
