# IWMSInternalAdminNetSource2::DeleteCredentialsEx


## -description



The <b>DeleteCredentialsEx</b> method removes a password from the cache. This improved version of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/16144c10-419c-4e6a-bc96-2f429c793257">IWMSInternalAdminNetSource::DeleteCredentials</a> uses the combination of realm, URL, and proxy use to identify the credentials. This is an improvement over using the realm by itself, which can easily be spoofed by malicious code.




## -parameters




### -param bstrRealm [in]

String containing the realm name. Realm names are supplied by servers to distinguish different levels of access to their files. Not all servers will have realm names, in which case the DNS name is used.


### -param bstrUrl [in]

String containing the URL to which the credentials apply.


### -param fProxy [in]

Boolean value that is True if the password applies when using a proxy server to access the site specified by <i>bstrUrl</i>.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.
