# IWMSInternalAdminNetSource::DeleteCredentials


## -description



The <b>DeleteCredentials</b> method removes a password from the cache.



This method has been superseded by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/06d82f1d-b965-40fb-8a79-904ba5af7191">IWMSInternalAdminNetSource2::DeleteCredentialsEx</a>. The methods of <b>IWMSInternalAdminNetSource2</b> are much more secure than the password caching methods in <b>IWMSInternalAdminNetSource</b> and should be used if available.


## -parameters




### -param bstrRealm [in]

String containing the realm name. Realm names are supplied by servers to distinguish different levels of access to their files. Not all servers will have realm names, in which case the DNS name is used.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.
