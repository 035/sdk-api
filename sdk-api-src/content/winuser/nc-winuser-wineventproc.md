# WINEVENTPROC callback


## -description


Used to declare a pointer to an application-defined callback function that the system calls in response to events that are generated by an accessible object.


## -parameters




### -param hWinEventHook

Handle to an event hook instance. This value is returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/090bda1b-0635-4aa3-ae33-3987b36e30b8">SetWinEventHook</a> when the hook function is installed, and it is specific to each instance of the hook function.


### -param event

Specifies the event that occurred. This value is one of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff597567">event constants</a>.


### -param hwnd

Handle to the window that generates the event, or <b>NULL</b> if no window is associated with the event; for example, the mouse pointer is not associated with a window.


### -param idObject

Identifies the object that is associated with the event. This is either one of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dc1603f8-29e5-4acd-817a-c6957feaff6c">object identifiers</a> or a custom object ID.


### -param idChild

Identifies whether the event was triggered by an object or a child element of the object. If this value is CHILDID_SELF, the event was triggered by the object; if this value is a child ID, the event was triggered by a child element.


### -param idEventThread


### -param dwmsEventTime

Specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the event was generated.


#### - dwEventThread

Identifies the thread that generated the event, or the thread that owns the current window.
