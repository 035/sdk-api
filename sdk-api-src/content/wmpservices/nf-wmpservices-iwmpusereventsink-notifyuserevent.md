# IWMPUserEventSink::NotifyUserEvent


## -description



The <b>NotifyUserEvent</b> method notifies an application of an event generated by a custom video presenter that the application provided to the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR).




## -parameters




### -param EventCode [in]

An event code that is meaningful only to the application and the custom video renderer. The event code must have a value greater than or equal to WMPUE_EC_USER, which is defined in wmpservices.h.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
                  Value
                </th>
<th>
                  Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S_OK</td>
<td>The method succeeded.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



An application that embeds the Windows Media Player control can provide a custom video renderer for the EVR by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a052aecc-b37f-4999-b484-80ee3e2392ba">IWMPVideoRenderConfig::put_presenterActivate</a>. As the custom video renderer runs, it can notify the EVR of events by calling <b>IMediaEventSink::Notify</b>. If the event code supplied by the custom video renderer is greater than or equal to WMPUE_EC_USER, the EVR passes the event notification along to the application by calling <b>NotifyUserEvent</b>.

The definition of WMPUE_EC_USER depends on the definition of EC_USER, which is defined in evcode.h.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This method is not supported.
