# _CRYPT_KEY_VERIFY_MESSAGE_PARA structure


## -description



			The <b>CRYPT_KEY_VERIFY_MESSAGE_PARA</b> structure contains information needed to verify signed messages without a certificate for the signer.


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

The size, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field dwMsgEncodingType

Type of encoding used. It is always acceptable to specify both the certificate and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4c4402e9-7455-4868-978f-3899a8fd86c1">message encoding types</a> by combining them with a bitwise-<b>OR</b> operation as shown in the following example:

X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING

Currently defined encoding types are:

<ul>
<li>X509_ASN_ENCODING</li>
<li>PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING</li>
</ul>

### -field hCryptProv

This member is not used and should be set to <b>NULL</b>.

<b>Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  </b>A handle to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/db46def4-bfdc-4801-a57d-d568e94a2dbb">cryptographic service provider</a> (CSP) to be used to verify a signed message. The CSP identified by this handle is used for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4165b820-30fc-477e-a690-81109f161323">hashing</a> and for signature verification.Unless there is a strong reason for using a specific cryptographic provider, set this member to  zero to use the default RSA or DSS provider.

This member's data type is <b>HCRYPTPROV</b>.
