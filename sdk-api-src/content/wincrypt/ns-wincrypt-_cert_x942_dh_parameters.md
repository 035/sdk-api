# _CERT_X942_DH_PARAMETERS structure


## -description


The <b>CERT_X942_DH_PARAMETERS</b> structure contains parameters associated with a Diffie-Hellman <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2fe6cfd3-8a2e-4dbe-9fb8-332633daa97a">public key algorithm</a>.


## -struct-fields




### -field p

Prime modulus P. The most significant bit of the most significant byte must always be set to 1.


### -field g

Generator G. Must be the same length as <b>p</b> (must be padded with 0x00 bytes if it is less).


### -field q

Prime Q. 




A factor of pâ€“1. The most significant bit of the most significant byte must be set to 1.


### -field j

Optional subgroup factor.


### -field pValidationParams

Optional pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/26c367d5-c338-4db3-9973-ce21dcddf7ca">CERT_X942_DH_VALIDATION_PARAMS</a> structure. If the <b>cbData</b> member of the q BLOB is zero, all of the members of <b>pValidationParams</b> must be zero.
