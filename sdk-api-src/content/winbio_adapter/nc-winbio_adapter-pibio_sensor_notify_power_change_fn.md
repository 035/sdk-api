# PIBIO_SENSOR_NOTIFY_POWER_CHANGE_FN callback function


## -description


Called by the Windows Biometric Framework when the system is ready to enter a low-power state or when the system has been awakened from a low-power state. The purpose of this function is to enable the adapter to respond to transitions in the computer power state.


## -parameters




### -param Pipeline [in, out]

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b5fc2b14-b0b6-4327-a42a-ecae41c3e12a">WINBIO_PIPELINE</a> structure associated with the biometric unit performing the operation


### -param PowerEventType [in]

Indicates the nature of the change. It can be one of the following values:



#### PBT_APMSUSPEND (The system is entering a low-power state)



##### )



####### )


## -returns



If the function succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ce52efc3-92c7-40e4-ac49-0c54049e169f">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

## -remarks



When it receives a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dc56fee3-e0df-4f8e-8a41-92460279280a">PBT_APMPOWERSTATUSCHANGE</a> event, the adapter should call the Microsoft Win32<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6d440ef2-2b9d-4f7a-a445-2420f07f3784">GetSystemPowerStatus</a>API to determine the new power status.

The biometric framework calls this adapter entry point asynchronously, in the context of an arbitrary thread. It is the adapter's responsibility to synchronize the processing of this call with any other work it may be doing.
