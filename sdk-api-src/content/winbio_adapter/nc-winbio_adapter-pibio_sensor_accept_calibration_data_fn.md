# PIBIO_SENSOR_ACCEPT_CALIBRATION_DATA_FN callback function


## -description


Called by the Windows Biometric Framework to pass calibration data from the engine adapter to the sensor adapter.


## -parameters




### -param Pipeline [in, out]

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b5fc2b14-b0b6-4327-a42a-ecae41c3e12a">WINBIO_PIPELINE</a> structure associated with the biometric unit performing the operation.


### -param CalibrationBuffer [in]

Pointer to the buffer that contains the calibration data.


### -param CalibrationBufferSize [in]

The size in bytes of the calibration buffer.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. If the function fails, it must return one of the following <b>HRESULT</b> values to indicate the error.

<table>

<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_some_error </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Any error code will cause the Biometric Service to discontinue the dynamic calibration loop and abort the capture operation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 




## -remarks



This method is called during a dynamic calibration loop.

The memory holding the calibration buffer belongs to the Windows Biometric Framework, and the Sensor Adapter must not keep any pointers to this buffer once the <b>SensorAdapterAcceptCalibrationData</b> method returns.
