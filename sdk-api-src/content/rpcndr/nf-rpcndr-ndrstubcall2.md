# NdrStubCall2 function


## -description


The <b>NdrStubCall2</b> function is the server-side entry point for <a href="midl._oi">/Oicf</a> mode stubs.  


## -parameters




### -param pThis [in]

Pointer to an instance of the CStdStubBuffer object, implementing  <a href="_com_irpcstubbuffer">IRpcStubBuffer</a>, for the DCOM interface.  Set to <b>NULL</b> for nonobject RPC interfaces.


### -param pChannel [in]

Pointer to <a href="_com_irpcchannelbuffer">IRpcChannelBuffer</a> for the DCOM interface, often provided by OLE. Set to <b>NULL</b> for nonobject interfaces.


### -param pRpcMsg [in, out]

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fd014622-97b3-4f76-8bc3-10821aa3c46e">RPC_MESSAGE</a> structure that  contains information about the RPC request. In nonobject interfaces, <i>pRpcMsg</i> also contains information about the remoting method.


### -param pdwStubPhase [out]

Pointer to a flag that tracks the current interpreter call's activity.


## -returns



Returns S_OK upon success. Raises an exception upon error.




## -remarks



The RPC run-time or OLE run-time calls <b>NdrStubCall2</b> to invoke the server manager routine. The [out] parameters are marshalled and returned to RPC run-time or OLE run-time to send back to the client.

The <i>pdwStubPhase</i> parameter is used by the object interface to determine exception handling behavior. The following table describes possible values for the <i>pdwStubPhase</i> parameter.
