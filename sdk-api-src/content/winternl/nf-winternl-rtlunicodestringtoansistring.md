## -description


Converts the specified Unicode source string into an ANSI string. 


## -parameters




### -param DestinationString [in, out]

A pointer to an <b>ANSI_STRING</b> structure to hold the converted ANSI string. If <i>AllocateDestinationString</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, the routine allocates a new buffer to hold the string data and updates the <b>Buffer</b> member of <i>DestinationString</i> to point to the new buffer. Otherwise, the routine uses the currently specified buffer to hold the string. 


### -param SourceString [in]

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564879">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that contains the source string to be converted to ANSI.


### -param AllocateDestinationString [in]

Controls allocation of the buffer space for the <i>DestinationString</i>. 



#### TRUE

Buffer space is allocated for <i>DestinationString</i>. If set to <b>TRUE</b>, the buffer must be deallocated using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561899">RtlFreeAnsiString</a>.



#### FALSE

Buffer space is not allocated for <i>DestinationString</i>.
